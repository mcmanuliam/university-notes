#### Cartesian Products & Relations
Consider a relation, where the two attributes have the same domain restrictions:

All possible rows in R: 
- Same as {0,1} x {a, b, c}

If we had less rows in our relation R, it would be a **subset** of {0,1} x {a, b, c}

#### Relations Between Elements of Sets
Relationships between elements of sets are represented using a structure called a _relation_. Specifically:

- **Definition of a Relation**: A relation R is a subset of the Cartesian product of the domains that define R.
- In other words, a relation is a subset of the Cartesian product of the domains of its attributes.
- _Relations_ are fundamental data structures used to store information in databases.

## Relational Algebra

- Sets and relations help us understand how the underlying data elements are structured in a database
- Relational Algebra helps us understand how the DBMS **extracts** the required data from the DB

**What is a Query??**

A query is performed when we wish to extract from the database a subset of the information that answers some question: 
- "What are the department names?"
- "Tell me all the data held about male employees."
- "What are the names of the employees in the R&D department?"

#### Back to Relational Algebra
Relational algebra is a set of operations which can be combined to provide the result of a query in the form of a relation.

- The algebra consists of: 
	- a collection of operations which fall into two categories:
		- special relational operations
		- traditional set operations
	- a form of "relational assignment" statement so that partial results can be assigned a name and passed to subsequent operations

##### Relational Assignment
A query is made up of a sequence of operations of the form:

Format: 
- newRelation := UnaryOperation parameter ( inputRelation )
	- Parameters can include column names or conditions Or (for a binary operator)
- newRelation := inputRelation(1) Operator(parameter) inputRelation(2)

##### Selection (Sigma)
$$\sigma(Condition) RelationName$$$$Locals := \sigma(city = "Glasgow") Employee$$
- where the condition can contain:
	- Literals, e.g. "Glasgow"
	- column names, e.g. city 
	- comparison operators ( =, >, etc. )
	- boolean operators ( and, not, or

##### Projection (Pi)
Extracts some of the columns from a relation, given the names

E.g. $$GenderSalary := \pi (gender, salary) (Employee)$$
- no attribute may occur more than once
- duplicates will be removed

##### Combination
Projection and selection can be combined $$\pi(house, street, city) (\sigma city = "Glasgow" (Employee))$$
##### Union
$$\cup$$
Produces a relation which combines two relations into a new relation containing all of the tuples from each (removing duplicates)

The two relations must be "union compatible" i.e. have the same number of attributes drawn from the same domain

##### Intersection
$$\cap$$
Similar to union but returns tuples that are in **both** relations

##### Difference
$$-$$
Similar to union but returns tuples that are in the first relation but not the second

#### Natural Join (⋈)

In its simplest form, the join of relations A and B pairs off the tuples of A and B so that identically named attributes from the relations have the same value

Employee and Department are two tables in a relational database:

- Employee (Name, NI-Number, Email, Phone-No, Works_In)
- Department (DeptName, Code, BuildingName)

The attribute Works_In is a foreign key in Employee relating to the primary key


(b) the names of all the employees of the "Accounts" department. $$AllEmployeeDepts := Employee ⋈ Works_In = Code Department $$$$AccountsEmployees := \sigma DeptName = “Accounts” (AllEmployeeDepts)$$$$AccountsEmployeesNames := \pi Name ( AccountsEmployees )$$
### CS1Q - Relational Algebra Quiz
Consider the following schema and corresponding relations:
- Sailors (sid, sname, rating, age) 
- Boats (bid, name, colour)
- Reservations (sid, bid, day)

![[Pasted image 20241112141937.png]]

Using relational algebra, write a solution to each of the following queries: 
1. Find the names of sailors who have reserved boat 101. 
	$$Sailors101 := \sigma(bid = 101)$$
$$Joined:=(Reservations \bowtie (sid = sid) Sailors101)$$
$$Project:=\pi(sname)Joined$$

2. Find the colours of boats reserved on 111201. 
		$$Day11201 := \sigma(day=111201)$$
	$$Joined := (Boats \bowtie (bid=bid) Day11201)$$
	$$Project := \pi(colour)Joined$$

3. Find the names of boats reserved on 1001001. $$day1001001 := \sigma(day=1001001)$$$$Joined := (Boats \bowtie (bid=bid) day1001001)$$$$Project := \pi(name)Joined$$
4. Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red boat. 
$$RedBoat := \sigma(colour='Red')$$
$$SemiJoined := (RedBoat \bowtie (bid=bid) Reservations)$$
$$FullyJoined := (SemiJoined \bowtie (sid=sid) Sailors)$$
$$Project := \pi(sname)$$

5. Find the names of boats that Tim has reserved. 
$$Tim := \sigma(sname='Tim')$$
$$SemiJoined := (Tim \bowtie (sid=sid) Reservations)$$
$$FullyJoined := (SemiJoined \bowtie (bid=bid) Boat)$$
$$Project:=\pi(name)$$

6. Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red or a green boat. 
$$ReddyGreen:=\sigma(color = red \cup green)$$
$$SemiJoined := (ReddyGreen \bowtie (bid=bid) Reservations)$$
$$FullyJoined := (SemiJoined \bowtie (sid=sid) Sailors)$$
$$Project:=\pi(name)$$

7. Find the names of sailors who have reserved a red and a green boat. 
8. Find the names of sailors who have reserved at least two boats (tricky!).
