#### Why Are Databases Important?
In 2025, the world will create (a very large number) bytes of data, 40% of that needs to be stored.

Databases are a key technology
- Used in a wide variety of applications to manage databases
- Growing in importance - amount of data we store is increasing

Consider the management of all of Facebook's user accounts and data…….. 
- This is a lot of data and a lot of data management involved!

On this course you will design, build, populate and query your own database using MySQL

It is important you understand the theory, as well as how to use MySQL, so that you will easily be able to design, build and use other database applications in the future

#### Data Information and Knowledge
Consider the example of handling the billing & monitoring of all UK household telephone calls
- What kinds of data would you have to store?

Answers:
- Telephone Numbers
- Persons Address
- Addresses
- Post Codes
- Account Codes
- Bank Details
- Money Owed

Can you think of any issues associated with managing this data on:
- Paper
- In Filing Cabinets
- In Spreadsheets

Answers:
- Storage
- Not shareable
- Not secure
- Hard to filter
- Hard to retrieve specific data

What about managing all of Amazon's databases
- 20 million products
- Need to hold terabytes of databases
- 310 million users, with thousands of users active at the same time
- Processing distributed around the world
- Need access to data for monitoring and looking for significant patterns
- Reliability and Security important
	- e.g. required by EU's GDPR

#### Managing Data
- If we've got lot's of data to store we need a really good way to store that data.
- We also need good ways to be able to access that data quickly and easily
- And we don't want lots of different versions of the data all over the place - we want to avoid REDUNDANCY.

Our data storage tool must provide these features:
- Data definition (data structuring)
- Data entry (to add new data)
- Data editing (to change existing data)
- Querying (a means of extracting data by a description)
- Persistence (data existing beyond a single operation or program invocation)

#### Strategies for Data Management
- A program where all the data is held in the program's memory
- But no data persistence between invocations of a program
- The data is reconstructed (or re-entered) at each invocation of the platform 

Files of data on disk that can be accessed by different applications
- Each application is responsible for it's own representations of the data 
- Difficult to coordinate between applications
- Might be different versions of the data

Combine together all the functions of data storage and access for a related set of tasks:
- handling student records
- Stock control in a warehouse
- Account management in a bank

This is know as a:
- **Database Management System** (DBMS) - [[2. Design & implementation of a (relational) database application]]
