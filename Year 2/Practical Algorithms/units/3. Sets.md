[[Set Notation]]
#### Sets - Introduction
- Set theory is a very important area of **mathematics**
- The set is considered the most fundamental notion in all of mathemaitcs!
- The notion of function is built on top of sets, A function assigns to each element of one set, exactly one element of another set.

#### Set: Definition
- A set is a collection of objects (called its elements/members) with a key property: membership
	- That is: "is this element a member of this set or not"? 

- Hence a set is an unordered collection of (unique) objects.
	- so, no concept of first element, 𝑛𝑡ℎ element, neighbouring element, etc. 
	- repetition does not matter
		- has no impact on whether or not an element is a member of a set

- A set is said to contain its elements. 

- The notation 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 denotes that 𝑎 is an element of the set 𝐴.
	- If 𝑎 is not a member of 𝐴, we write: 𝑎 ∉ 𝐴

#### Roster Notation

```
S = {a, b, c, d}
```

Just like an object in code, order wont have any effect:

```
S = {a, b, c, d} = {d, b, c, a}
```

Multiplicity is ignored, this is like the reduce function in lodash:

```
S = {a, b, c, d} = {a, a, a, b, c, d}
```

Ellipses (…) may be used to describe a set without listing all its members, when the pattern can be clearly derived from the context:

```
S = {a, b, ..., c}
```


##### Limitations
Using the roster method, try to describe: 
- All pair of natural numbers (x,y) that satisfy the equation x + y = 1000 
- All positive rational number

Either not possible, or very inconvenient…

#### Set-Builder Notation

Specify the property/properties that characterize its membership:

```python
𝑆 = {𝑥 | 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛 100}
𝑂 = {𝑥 | 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑎𝑛 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛 10}
𝑃 = {𝑥 ∈ ℤ+ | 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥 < 10}
# ^ x is in Z and x is odd and x < 10 (this could be on the right but it's normal o do it on the left with set members), the plus is essentially a filter to positive numbers, in the case there is a star that means the zero get's filtered.
```

This works kind of like types in the way that you can specify something like `keyof {{interface}} and string` and through that typing we can determine the values in the set.

- A predicate may be used for succinctness
	- (where a predicate is basically a logical statement that can be True or False, depending on some variable(s).)

```python
𝑆 = {𝑥 | 𝑃(𝑥)}

# | can be read as “such that”
# ∈ can be read as “belongs to” 
# 𝑷(𝒙) here means 𝑃 is a predicate that is True for 𝑥
```

Example: 
- Example: `𝑆 = {𝑥 | 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒(𝑥)}`
- Example: Set of positive rational numbers: 
	`ℚ+ = {𝑥 ∈ ℝ | 𝑥 = 𝑝/𝑞, for some positive integers 𝑝, 𝑞}`

#### Some Common Sets
- Natural numbers `ℕ = {0, 1, 2, 3, … }`
- Integers `ℤ = {… − 3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, … } `
	- Negative and Positives
- Positive integers `ℤ+ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, … }`
- Rational numbers `ℚ = 𝑝 𝑞 𝑝, 𝑞 ∈ ℤ and 𝑞 ≠ 0}`
	- Numbers that can be written as fractions
- Real numbers ℝ

#### Universal Set and Empty Set
- The universal set U is the set containing everything currently under consideration.
	- Sometimes implicit
	- Sometimes explicitly stated.
	- Depends on context
	
- The empty set ∅ = {} is the set with no elements.
	- The empty set doesn't contain anything but it is something, imagine putting an empty set in another set, like `{{}, a, b, c}` see the empty set is still a set.

#### Set Equality

##### Some Pre-requisite Symbols

| Symbol  | Meaning                          |
| ------- | -------------------------------- |
| ∀       | For all                          |
| A → B   | If A is true, then B is true     |
| 𝐴 𝐵 A | is true if and only if B is true |
| ∧       | Logical AND                      |
| ∨       | Logical OR                       |

Examples:
- {1, 3, 5} = {3, 5, 1}
- {1, 5, 5, 5, 3, 3, 1} = {1, 3, 5}
- {1, 3, 7} ≠ {1, 3}

#### Subsets
The set A is a subset of B, denoted by  `𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵`, if and only if every element of A is also an element of B.
- Imagine inheritance, B is a parent of A.

Formally: `𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵` if and only if `∀𝑥(𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 → 𝑥 ∈ 𝐵 ) `

Note that:
- `∅ ⊆ 𝑆` for every set 𝑆.
	- Empty set doesn't contain anything that the parent doesn't.
- `𝑆 ⊆ 𝑆` for every set 𝑆.

#### Equality
Two set are equal if and only if they are subsets of each other:

```
A = B if and only if 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐵 ⊆ 𝐴
```
***Note: Imagine the full circle.***

![[image17.png]]

#### "Proper" Subset
 We say that 𝐴 is a proper subset of 𝐵, if and only if:
 - 𝐴 is a subset of 𝐵, but 𝐴 is not equal to 𝐵: 
 
 ```
 𝐴 ⊆ 𝐵 ∧ 𝐴 ≠ 𝐵
 ```
#### Set Cardinality
The cardinality of a finite set A, denoted by |A|, is the number of (distinct) elements of A.

***This is essentially the length of the type. How many items are implicitly or explicitly in the set***

Examples: 
- ∅ = 0 
- Let 𝑆 be the set of all letters of the English alphabet. Then |𝑆| = 26
- |{1, 2, 3}| = 3
- |{∅}| = 1
- Set of integers? Infinite 
	- Think about countable infinities
		- numbers including negatives are a larger infinite than the positive integers.
		- What about real numbers they are a larger infinite than integers.

#### Power Sets
The power set of a given set 𝐴, denoted 𝒫(𝐴), is the set of all subsets of 𝐴.

- This is a type that contains a bunch of other types:
	- Object is a Power set of date, 
	
```
Object
├── Array
├── Function
├── Date
```

- Example: If `𝑆 = {𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐}` then 

```
𝒫 𝐴 = {∅, {𝑎}, {𝑏}, {𝑐}, {𝑎, 𝑏}, {𝑎, 𝑐}, {𝑏, 𝑐}, {𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐}}
```

- If a set has 𝑛 elements, then the cardinality (i.e. size) of the power set is 2𝑛. That is, 
	- `𝐴 = 𝑛 → 𝒫 𝐴 = 2𝑛`

Let `𝑆 = 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐 `. Each subset of `𝑆` can be represented as a bit string of length 𝑆 = 3 , where each component is: 
- 1 if corresponding element is a member of `𝑆` 
- 0 if not a member

Therefore, the size of `𝒫(𝑆)` is `2𝑛`:
- the number of bit strings of length 𝑛 (we will see at a later unit exactly why…)

#### Cartesian Product
The Cartesian product is a way to combine two sets by pairing every element of one set with every element of another set.
#### Simple Explanation
If you have two sets, say:

- Set A: `{1, 2}`
- Set B: `{x, y}`

The **Cartesian product** of A and B, written as `A × B`, is the set of all possible ordered pairs where the first element is from A and the second element is from B.

So, in this example, `A × B` would be:

```
A × B = { (1, x), (1, y), (2, x), (2, y) }
```

#### How It Works

1. **Take one element** from the first set (e.g., `1` from A).
2. **Pair it with each element** in the second set (so, `1` pairs with both `x` and `y`).
3. Repeat this for every element in the first set.

### Visual Example
Think of it like a grid where Set A elements are on one axis and Set B elements are on the other. Each cell in the grid is a unique pairing:

|   | x   | y   |
|---|-----|-----|
| 1 |(1,x)|(1,y)|
| 2 |(2,x)|(2,y)|

#### Key Points
- **Order Matters**: `(1, x)` is different from `(x, 1)`, so the order of sets matters.
- **Size of Result**: If Set A has `m` elements and Set B has `n` elements, the Cartesian product will have `m * n` pairs.

#### Everyday Example
If you have two shirts (A: `red` and `blue`) and two pants (B: `jeans` and `khakis`), the Cartesian product would give you all possible outfit combinations:

```
Outfits = { (red, jeans), (red, khakis), (blue, jeans), (blue, khakis) }
```

This is the Cartesian product of your shirts and pants!

```javascript
function cartesianProduct(setA, setB) {
	const product = [];
	
	for (const elemA of setA) {
		for (const elemB of setB) {
			product.push([elemA, elemB]);
		}
	} 

	return product; 
}

const setA = [1, 2];
const setB = ['x', 'y'];
console.log(JSON.stringify(cartesianProduct(setA, setB)));
```

#### Boolean Algebra!
Set theory can be interpreted as an instance of an algebraic system called a Boolean Algebra.
- We will look at another Boolean algebra later called "propositional calculus

The operators in set theory are analogous to the corresponding Boolean operators we have already seen.

Recall the definition of universal set U
- All sets are assumed to be subsets of U

#### Union
- **Definition**: The union of the sets 𝐴 and 𝐵, denoted by 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵, is the set: 

```
{x|x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B} # Analogous to the logical OR
```

- **Example**: What is {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4, 5} ? 
- **Answer**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

![[image18.png]]

#### Intersection
- **Definition**: The intersection of sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is:

```
{x|x ∈ A ^ x ∈ B} # Analogous to the logical AND
```

- ***Note: if the intersection 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 is empty, then sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 are said to be disjoint.*** 

- **Example**: What is {1, 2, 3} ∩ {3, 4, 5} ?
	- **Answer**: {3}

- **Example**: What is {1, 2, 3} ∩ {4 , 5, 6} ? 
	- **Answer**: ∅ 

![[image19.png]]

#### Complement
- **Definition**: the complement of 𝐴 (with respect to a given universal set 𝑈), denoted by Ā (or 𝐴𝑐) is the set: 

```
Ā = 𝑥 ∈ 𝑈 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴} # Analogous to the logical NOT
```

- **Example**: If 𝑈 is the positive integers less than 100, what is the complement of {𝑥 | 𝑥 > 70} ? Answer: {1, 2, … , 70} ?

```
Negation with: x<=70
```

- **Answer**: {1, 2, …, 70}

![[image20.png]]

#### Difference
- Definition: The difference of 𝐴 from 𝐵, denoted by 𝐴 – 𝐵 (or 𝐴 ∖ 𝐵), is the set containing the all elements of 𝐴 that are not in 𝐵.

```
𝐴 − B = {𝑥 | 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∧ 𝑥 ∉ 𝐵} = 𝐴 ∩ Ḃ
```

- 𝐴 − 𝐵 is also called the complement of B with respect to A

#### Problem Set 3.1: Sets
- [x]  🔽 🛫 2024-11-04 ✅ 2024-11-05

[Link](https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/mod/book/view.php?id=4586543&chapterid=162846#mod_book-chapter)

*We looked at the notion of **Cartesian product** during our lecture earlier. Basically, the Cartesian product of two sets lists all possible pairs you can make from the elements of those two sets. E.g., if A is the set of all possible Ranks in a deck of cards,  and B is a rank of all 4 suits:* 

_A = {A, K, Q, …, 2}  
B = {spade, diamond, heart, club}  
  
Then the Cartesian product AxB will give you all possible cards in a deck: {(A, spade), (K, spade), …, (A, diamond), (K, diamond), …}  
  
You can have a Cartesian product of **more than two** sets as well, though:

**1)**  What is `A×B×C`, where `A={0,1}, B={1,2}` and `C={0,1,2}`?

| A   | B   | C   |           |
| --- | --- | --- | --------- |
| 1   | 0   | 0   | (0, 1)    |
| 1   | 1   | 0   | (0, 1, 2) |
| 1   | 1   | 1   | (0, 1, 2) |
| 0   | 0   | 0   | ()        |
| 0   | 0   | 1   | (0, 1, 2) |
| 0   | 1   | 1   | (0, 1, 2) |
| 0   | 1   | 0   | (1, 2)    |


```
{
	(),
	(0, 1),
	(0, 2),
	(0, 1, 2),
	(0, 1, 2),
	(0, 1, 2),
	(0, 1, 2),
}
```

**2)** Let `P(C)` denote the power set of `C`. Given sets` A={1,2}` and` B={2,3`}. determine:

- `P(A ∩ B)`
- `P(A)`
- `P(A ∪ B)
- `P(A × B)`

*Sets can be represented using, either the roster notation (e.g. S={1,2,3}S={1,2,3}), or the set-builder notation (e.g. S={x∈Z+|x<4}S={x∈Z+|x<4}).*

| A      | B      |
| ------ | ------ |
| (1, 2) | (1, 3) |
| (2, 2) | (2, 3) |

```
- C = {2}
- C = {1, 2}
- C = {1, 2, 3}
- C = {∅, (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 2), (2, 3)}
```

**3)** List the members of the following sets (recall that `Z` is the set of integers and `N` is the set of natural numbers).

**a)** $$\{x|x \in \mathbb{Z} \land x^2=5\}$$
$$\emptyset$$
**b)** $$\{5x|x \in \mathbb{z} \land (-2 \leq x \leq 2)\}$$
$$\{-10, -5, 0, 5, 10\}$$
**c)** $$\{x|x \in \mathbb{N} \land x^2 \in \{1, 4, 9\}\}$$
$$\{1, 2, 3\}$$

**d)**
$$\{x|x \in \mathbb{z} \land x^2 \in \{1, 4, 9\}\}$$
$$\{-4, -3, -1, 1, 3, 4\}$$

**4)** Suppose `A = {a, b, c}` and `B = {b, {c}}`. Mark each of the following as *true* or *false*.

**a)**  {a, c} in A - True
**b)** {c} subset B - True
**c)** B subset A - False
**d)** {b, c} in P(A) - True
**e)** {{a}} subset P(A) - True
**f)** {b, {c}} in P - True
**g)** {{{c}}} subset P(B) - True
**h)** |P(AxB)| = 32 - False

**Proving set identities**  
So we looked at some set identities in the lecture earlier. But, how can we prove that they are correct?   
  
There are a number of ways to do this, and we will work with the most straightforward one -- the *membership table method*.  
  
So for example, you want to show that: 

![[image25.png]]

What you do is use the logical equivalence between:  
+  binary OR and ∪ operation  
+ binary AND and ∩ operation, and  
+ binary inverse and A¯A¯  
  
And then effectively create the set counterpart of a binary **truth table,** to show the equivalence of two sets:  

![[image26.png]]

In a truth table create for binary variables, a variable being 0 or 1 simple represents its logical value.  
  
In the set world, when we create the membership table as shown above, the "variables" are actually sets. So what does it mean to say A = 0 or 1 when it is a set?  
  
+  A = 0 means: "an arbitrary  element is *not* a member of A"  
+ A = 1 means : "an arbitrary  *is a* member of set A_"_   
  
So, when we have the exact same values in both columns of interest up there, that shows us that: for all possible elements (that is, all possible combinations of an element being or not being a member of A or B), if it is a member of the first, it is a member of the second, and if it is not a member of the first, it is not a member of the second. That, in effect, is set equality.  
  
Another way to do this would be to show both sets are subsets of one another, which is of course only possible if they are equal.  
  
Right, here's the problem for you then:

Using the membership table method, prove the distributive law:

$$A \cap (B \cup C) = (A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$$

| A   | B   | C   | $$(B \cup C)$$ | $$A \cap (B \cup C)$$ | $$A \cap B$$ | $$A \cap C$$ | $$(A \cap B) \cup (A \cap C)$$ |

**TRUE**


**8)** Using set data structures in Python for greater good

**8a)**  Using sets in Python, create and test a function `count_unique()` that counts the number of unique elements in a given list.  E.g. if you test it with  `L = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, it should return: 6

```python
list = [1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]

def count_unique(LIST):
	SET = set(LIST)
	return len(SET)

print(count_unique(list))
```

**8b)** Using set operations in Python, create and then test a function `absent_alphabets()` which, when passed a string with small-caps English alphabets and whitespace only, returns a list of the alphabets that are missing in that list. So e.g.  
`absent_alphabets("A quick brown yes quick brown fox oh that quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat")` should return the list `['d', 'g']`

```python
ALPHABET = {'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z'}

def absent_alphabets(raw):
	string = raw.replace(" ", "")
	missing_char = []
	string_set = set(string)
	
	for char in ALPHABET:
		if char not in string_set:
			missing_char.append(char)

	return missing_char
	
sentence = 'A quick brown yes quick brown fox oh that quick brown fox jumps over the lazy cat'
print(absent_alphabets(sentence))
```

**8c)** Create a function `order_neutral_list_comparison()` that accepts two lists as arguments, and `returns True` if they both have the same unique elements, irrespective of their order. So e.g.   `order_neutral_list_comparison([1,3,5,7,9], [1,5,7,9,9,3])` should return `True`.

```python
def compare_set(list1, list2):
	set1 = set(list1)
	set2 = set(list2)
	
	if (set1 == set2):
		return True 
	else:
		return False

SET_1 = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
SET_2 = [1, 5, 7, 9, 9, 3]
print(compare_set(SET_1, SET_2))
```
