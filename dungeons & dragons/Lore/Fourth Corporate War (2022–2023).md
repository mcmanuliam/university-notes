The Fourth Corporate War was a brutal conflict between megacorps **Militech** and **Arasaka**, it started small - **two rival shipping companies** hired mercenaries and "security forces" to sabotage each other. It **escalated massively** when their parent corporations (Militech and Arasaka) got personally involved.

The war ended after a **nuclear bomb** destroyed **Arasaka Tower** in **Night City**, triggering massive public outrage. Governments intervened:

- The **U.S. nationalised Militech**,
- **Japan forced Arasaka to stand down**,
- and world trade collapsed.

Both corporations were devastated. Cities became semi-independent, the global internet (Net) was sealed off, and the world slipped into chaos.

**Nobody truly won â€” the world simply survived.**

# Aftermath

- **Arasaka** was heavily discredited and shattered globally.
- **Militech** survived but became more closely tied to the U.S. government.
- The world became **fragmented**, with local governments, city-states, and corporate enclaves replacing national governments in many places.
- High-level technology became rare - people in 2045 often scavenge and rebuild.
- The global internet (the "old Net") was wrecked by rogue AIs during the war.

# The Net

- The old Net (the deep internet) is sealed behind the **Blackwall**. Only specialized netrunners (or crazy fools) go there.  
- Most normal people use a **shallow, local "City Net"** - safe but heavily policed.
