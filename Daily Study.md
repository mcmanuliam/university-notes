- [ ] **ðŸ“… 2025-04-14 ðŸ”º DSF Class Test**

The main focus for today and tomorrow should be on getting the Studying done for DSF, the class quizzes have been okay but I'll still need to revise up on some of the stuff we've covered.

- [x] **1. Numerical Arrays** âœ… 2025-04-11
	- [x] 1.1 Go over all operations and how they are handled in Python âœ… 2025-04-11
		- [x] 1.1.2 Should double check floating point representation âœ… 2025-04-11
	- [x] 1.2 Go over the lab again trying a few of the Python examples. âœ… 2025-04-11

- [x] **2. Visualisation** âœ… 2025-04-12
	- [x] 2.1 Recap the entire topic, there was a lot here and I imagine a lot will come up in the test. âœ… 2025-04-12
	- [x] 2.2 Go over the Graph Basics âœ… 2025-04-12
	- [x] 2.3 Go over Geoms, Coords, Facets and Layers âœ… 2025-04-12
	- [x] 2.4 Rewatch lectures âœ… 2025-04-12
	- [x] 2.5 Give a go at coding some of the graphs in the lab exercises. âœ… 2025-04-12

- [ ] **3. Computational Linear Algebra**
	- [ ] 3.1 This one will be fun, first it'll be best to catch up on the notes and lectures, go over a few.
	- [ ] 3.2 Then try and get a few examples for matrix operations and calculate them yourself.
	- [ ] 3.3 Then the next bet is to start on doing some of it in Python.

- [ ] **4. Class Questions**
	- [ ] 4.1 Go back and redo all class questions
	- [ ] 4.2 Ask Deepseek to generate questions based off the class ones, attempt them.
