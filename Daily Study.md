***Quick note used during exams, just a todo. Allows me to keep track of Studying needing done during work time.***

- [ ] **ðŸ“… 2025-05-20 ðŸ”º UI Exam**
- [ ] **ðŸ“… 2025-05-22 ðŸ”º DSF Exam**
- [ ] **ðŸ“… 2025-05-23 ðŸ”º ALGO Exam**

Okay tons to cover in the next month, these are all open book but it would be good to learn these:

- **DSF** is the priority - need to relearn that whole course (hopefully coursework comes back positive) but still 70% exam and nobody's entirely sure. 

- **UI** doesn't seem too bad although there was a few questions that I got wrong in the class test, might be good to take a look over the course and double check I got everything noted down.

- **ALGO** is a slight issue, looking back at previous exams I think I'm good on most of it but NP Completeness is tough and that seems to be a majority of the exam so need to wrap my head round that.

# Next Steps:

## DSF

- [ ] **1. Numerical Arrays**
	- [ ] 1.1 Go over all operations and how they are handled in Python
		- [ ] 1.1.2 Should double check floating point representation
	- [ ] 1.2 Go over the lab again trying a few of the Python examples.

- [ ] **2. Visualisation**
	- [ ] 2.1 Recap the entire topic, there was a lot here and I imagine a lot will come up in the test.
	- [ ] 2.2 Go over the Graph Basics
	- [ ] 2.3 Go over Geoms, Coords, Facets and Layers
	- [ ] 2.4 Rewatch lectures
	- [ ] 2.5 Give a go at coding some of the graphs in the lab exercises.

- [ ] **3. Matrices
	- [ ] 3.1 This one will be fun, first it'll be best to catch up on the notes and lectures, go over a few.
	- [ ] 3.2 Then try and get a few examples for matrix operations and calculate them yourself.
	- [ ] 3.3 Then the next bet is to start on doing some of it in Python.

- [ ] **4. Class Questions**
	- [ ] 4.1 Go back and redo all class questions
	- [ ] 4.2 Ask Deepseek to generate questions based off the class ones, attempt them.
