Rational Band • Occupy minutes or hours • Tasks, like website use, user search strategies, IS navigation • Users must experience an interface and make decisions about their next actions • Consider an evaluation of user search behavior • How often do users “branch” their search results? • How many “branches” do users generate during a typical search? • Why do users establish a new “branch” Social Band • Days, weeks and months • Activities such as workplace habits, social networking, online dating, privacy • Require development of social bonds or establishing norms/ standards • Consider a study on people developing relationships in online dating • Interviews with members of the community • Participation/observation in active forums • Qualitative methods dominate • Although often opportunity for mixed methods studies/data analytics too • For refence https://theblog.okcupid.com Model of Human Computer InteractionGulfs of Interaction • Evaluation: Understanding the state of the system • Execution: Taking action to accomplish a specific goalHeuristic Evaluation Lecture 3EVALUATE! Heuristic evaluation • Heuristic evaluation is a usability engineering method for finding the usability problems in a user interface design. • Involves having a small set of evaluators examine an interface and judge its compliance with usability principles. Further Reading: https://www.nngroup.com/articles/how-to-conduct-a-heuristic-evaluation/ (with Neilsen’s usability heuristics) Heuristic evaluation • Usability issues are judged against standard heuristics to provide consistent targets. • Aggregated issues are plotted in a standard format. • Each issue is analysed for the difficulty to correct it and importance. Evaluators • Each evaluator finds as many problems as possible alone. • Evaluators find different problems. • On average, a single evaluator finds only 35% of usability issues identified by a group. • Diminishing returns when numerous evaluators are used. • Nielson recommends up to five evaluators but should consider the cost/benefit in the specific context. nngroup.com Reports • Problems are presented as a written report. • Problems can be captured by recording a verbal exchange between evaluator and moderator. • This is converted into a written report by the moderator. Aggregating reports • A complete list of problems is aggregated from all reports. • Each unique problem is labelled, and these labels are applied to all reports. • Each problem must be associated with a usability heuristic. • A matrix is created with problems along the x-axis and evaluator along the y-axis. • This is sorted first by y-axis (successful evaluators) and second by x-axis (difficult to find problems). nngroup.com Analysing problems • Consider the prevalence of the problem. • How many evaluators found it? • Consider the ease of correcting the problem. • Consider the importance of the problem. • Propose solutions and a ranked list of priority.

ASSIGNMENT INFORMATION Heuristic Evaluation Assessment • This assessment is due 18th April. • Extensions are always available. • It is worth 20% of your course grade. • Your marks and feedback will be returned by the end of 12th May. • It is a group assessment. This assessment is made up of the following components: • Select an website from the provided list. • Design three tasks for participants to complete. • Have every member of another group complete the three tasks. • Collate evaluator reports and generate a summary table. • Write a summary of your findings (750 words). • Contribution statement Please complete these steps as soon as possible – ideally in the next day or two – so that the other group can start prepping for their video presentation… Heuristic Evaluation Assessment •Interface Selection • You will be completing a heuristic evaluation of one of three possible websites. • Choose one of the following: • Yale Art School • H&M • Guide.com • Design three short tasks that you will ask evaluators in another group to perform and report their findings on. Example tasks: • Find a given piece of content – Find the course speciation for the MSci in Computing Science on the University of Glasgow website. • Browse a given topic – Find information on video games research on the University of Glasgow website. Heuristic Evaluation Assessment •Evaluator Reports • Using the Evaluator Report Template, the students in the next group after yours on Teams will act as evaluators in your heuristic evaluation. • You should collect all their reports for inclusion in your submission. • You should include all the evaluation reports completed by your group in your submission, too. Heuristic Evaluation Assessment •Heuristic Evaluation • Collate the reports you have collected into a matrix with usability problems on the x-axis and evaluators on the y-axis. • Once this is complete, write a summary of the results (up to 750 words) describing the issues uncovered during the evaluation. • This should include a summary of the issues and a discussion of priority of each issue. Submission Instructions One member of your group must submit your work on Moodle as a single PDF document that contains: • Evaluator Reports for your Heuristic Walkthrough • Summary of Results (Table and up to 750 words) • Evaluator Reports you have Completed • Ethics Checklist for Assessed Work (available on Moodle) Presentation Assessment • This assessment is due 9 April. • Extensions are always available. • It is worth 5% of your course grade. • Your marks and feedback will be returned by the end of 30 April. • It is a group assessment. Instructions • Select four or five usability issues that you have identified in your assigned website. • Record a video of up to four or five minutes in duration that demonstrates each of these issues. • Each issue should be illustrated using video or screenshots captured from the website. • For each issue, explain which usability heuristic it relates to, and how. • For each issue, suggest how it may be fixed. Assessment Criteria Mark s Identifying up to five usability issues based on Nielsen’s usability heuristics. 5 Explaining how each of the issue relates to the relevant heuristic. 10 Explaining how each issue may be fixed. 5 Presenting the video in a clear, professional manner, keeping to time, etc. 2 Questions?
