You’re gonna love Black Chrome. Why? It’s got everything a Cyberpunk needs. Guns, Cyberware, Gear, Vehicles. Each has been painstakingly crafted by the finest Techs to bring digital tears to your cybereyes and has been properly weighed to keep your campaign in balance. To build this treasure trove you hold in your hands we bent all the rules but broke none that didn’t deserve it. With all this new chrome, Complete Package Character Generation will probably take a little longer, but it’s gonna be worth it. Customization is the new black, and, as you’ll notice, Black is the new Chrome. This book isn’t just full of items, it’s also full of lore about those who make those items and how to get them into your hands. You’ll learn about the Economy of 2045, meet some Fixers, and tour their Night Markets, fully realized with maps and ideas of what all you can find at each stall. Alongside fan-favorite Corporations, you’ll notice plenty of new ones, and as you read through these items, you’ll learn their stories. You should read closely; it might help you when those Corps knock down your cargo container door or contact your Fixer for a simple job. Execs, take notes! We hear they are hiring. Take anything you want from this book. Homebrew it as you please, as is your right. Take a weapon and ponder, “what if this was a Sniper Rifle?”. Take it to your Tech in-game and ask your GM (out of game) if it’s possible. Cyberpunk RED is a system for builders, and Black Chrome is a book full of tools. Use them as you see fit.

Talsorian published Chromebook, a catalog of gear, weapons, vehicles, fashion, cyber- ware, and more for the classic Cyberpunk 2020, originally created by Benjamin Wright, Mike Roter, Jeff Hexter, and the rest of the I-Con crew. It was, simply put, a book of stuff presented as an in-world catalog Edgerunners could browse to find the latest tech to insert some style and some substance into their lives. How could we do any different with Cyberpunk RED? Black Chrome provides the same function, only we’ve updated the concept for the 2045 era. Here’s the deets. The old Chromebook catalog was managed and generated by the many corporations providing goodies for the up-and-chroming punk of the 2020s. But in the wake of the 4th Corporate War blowing up the supply lines, the professionally spon- sored Chromebook catalog foundered. After all, what good is a catalog full of bleeding-edge gear in a world where Fixers and Night Markets serve as your point of contact for snagging up the good swag? Don’t worry, though. Chromebook’s not gone. It just evolved. In the Time of the Red, Chromebook’s like a clunky old car that slammed headlights first into a building and CBK’s the shiny new supercycle climbing out of the wreckage. W hat is CBK? w h a t i s c bk w h a t i s c bk CBK (pronounced Cee Book) is what you might call a Night Market companion app. Just download it to your Agent, for free, and use it to enhance your Night Market shopping experience. Outside of a Night Market, CBK doesn’t do much good as all you’ll get is a “searching for database” message. Once you hit a Night Market, though, you’ll receive an instant inventory of what’s available, information on where to go, and even options to buy items without seeing them so some doomba doesn’t snipe in and grab your new favorite gun before you can make the trip from the entrance to a booth way the hell over on the other side of the warehouse. Here’s how it works. The Fixer in charge of a Night Market uses the CBK Fixer app to set up a database of item listings, inputting information like the name and description of the item, the cost, the location in the Night Market, and so forth. Fixers can input their own descriptions and add their own image to an item’s listing or pick from thousands of pre-existing choices updated regularly by the fine folks behind the app. This is how CBK makes money, by the way; Fixers pay 1eb per listing to use the pre-existing info and photos (minimum 50eb). Most find the time saved makes up for the cost incurred. Once they’ve got their database fully kitted out, the Fixer pushes the GO LIVE button and sets their Agent to broadcast inside the Night Market. Many Fixers buy a dedicated Agent just for this purpose since shutting down the app also shuts down the database broadcast. Meanwhile, as the customers filter into the Night Market, they launch the CBK app on their own Agents. The app searches for a nearby, active database. Once found, it accesses the data from the Fixer’s Agent and populates itself with an easily browsable listing of all the goods and services on offer. Users can scan the listings by category or search them using keywords to find items of interest. In calling up a listing, they’ll be able to see a picture of the item, read (or listen) to information about it, find out how much it costs, locate its position inside the Night Market, and even purchase it. All from the comfort of their Agent. There’s additional functionality as well. Fixers can use CBK to send alerts to the Agents of Night Market custom- ers, including announcements about flash sales, warn- ings about impending raids by NCPD or other hostile groups, and friendly reminders about weapon policies or future Market dates. Plus, users can send messages to any Fixer working the Night Market, asking for more information on a product or a private meeting. W hat’s a Night Market again? w h at sa n i g h t m a r k e taga i n Or hOw these fit intO yOur game, gms. We keep mentioning Night Markets (see CP:R page 337) and that’s important. In the Time of the Red, Night Markets are the most reliable way to browse a large quantity of expensive goods in a 7 USING BLACK CHROME single location. In fact, Night Markets are so import- ant we’ve included six examples in this book (see page 131) with information on how often they’re held, where they’re held, what they generally sell, who runs them, and even how your own Player Character Fixer can get in on the action and take part. Plus, there’s a full-spread map of each Night Market, so you know exactly how each looks. Here’s the clever part. When using one of the Night Markets from Black Chrome, the GM should first determine what goods it sells either randomly, using the rules from the Core Rulebook (see CP:R page 338), or by picking and choosing based on their own preferences and goals. In addition to those items, there’s a chance shoppers will find the specific goods listed in Black Chrome there as well. Each listing (except Apps) contains a line reading: “Pick-up or Browse at Booth @#” where @ equals a letter and # equals a number. The letter indicates one of the six specific Night Markets (see page 131), while the number points to a location inside as detailed on its map. In other words, the GM can just hand over the book to their players and say, “In addition to the cyber- decks, programs, and personal electronics from the Cyberpunk RED core rulebook, you can also find any item from this book listed as being in a booth start- ing with the letter B.” Want to do something similar but using a Night Market you’ve made up? Here’s some ideas. If you’ve got the physical book, attach one of those sticky flags made for notetaking on any item the Night Market offers. Users of the digital book might need to change it up and offer Players a list with names and page numbers so they can check their own copies. Either way, giving the Players a chance to browse the in-world listings on their CBK app adds a fun layer of immersion you can’t get from just calling out names on a spreadsheet.BY SAGA MACKENZIE See CP:R means check the Cyberpunk RED core rulebook. 8 USING BLACK CHROME R eading the Listings r e a d i n gth e l i st i n gs r e a d i n gt rh e l i st i n gs Here’s how to read and work with each item listing in Black Chrome (the position and arrangement of this information might change depending on the item type and listing size). 1. A photo of the item. These photos usually come from promotional images, so the actual item sold by the Night Market might vary in color, features, or condition. 2. The item’s name, the manufacturing Corp (if there is one), and the initial amount of Eurobucks the Fixer is asking for. 3. The logo of the manufacturing Corp (if there is one). 4. The sales pitch. In-world info about the item often grabbed directly from press releases, advertisements, reviews, or the back of the box. Much like the image, the actual item sold by the Night Market may not be exactly what the sales pitch offers. 5. This is where we put the important information on how the item works within the rules of Cyberpunk RED. For vehicles, this includes the Nomad Access value (see page 9). Not all listings include rules text. Some just add flavor to the game. 6. The Buy Now!!! button. Users of CBK tap this to buy the item from anywhere in the Night Market. After making the purchase, they can pick it up at their leisure by showing the receipt on their Agent. Buyer beware, though! Few Fixers offer refunds. 7. Just below the Buy Now!!! button is information about where you can find the item physically in the Night Market (not present for Apps). 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 9 USING BLACK CHROME A Bit About Keywords a b it a b o utk e y w o r d s In designing Cyberpunk RED (and this book) we made use of Keywords: terms with specific meaning in the rules, repeated as needed. A simple example would be “Heavy Pistol”. If we say something is a “Heavy Pistol” you know the starting damage, range DVs, Rate of Fire, ammo count, and so forth based on the rules in the core rulebook. Black Chrome intro- duces several new Keywords. For convenience, here’s a listing of them and their definitions. App: A program designed to run on an Agent. It can be purchased via the CitiNet or directly from a vendor. Combination: The weapon combines the features of two or more weapons. It has multiple modes, one for each weapon type. The user must decide what mode to use when attacking with the weapon (for example, either Crossbow or Rifle). Switching between modes does not require an Action. Unless stated otherwise, a malfunction/jam in one mode does not cause a malfunction/jam in the other mode. Continues to Halve SP When Thrown: Unlike standard thrown weapons, divide SP by half when calculating damage to a target. Counts as Half of a 2 ROF Attack: Usually assigned to a thrown weapon. When throwing the weapon, it is 2 ROF and not the usual 1, meaning the user can perform another 2 ROF Attack Check if possible. Cyberfinger: A type of cyberware in the form of a finger. They require a Modular Finger Cyberhand for installation. Damage Directly to Their HP: The damage is sub- tracted from the target’s HP. Armor does not reduce it, nor is it ablated. The damage is not multiplied based on location. Destroyed: The item is broken and unusable but can be repaired. Destroyed Beyond Repair: The item is broken and unusable and cannot be repaired. Explosive: A device that explodes. They sometimes act like Grenade or Rocket Ammunition in terms of area of effect or damage but cannot be loaded into weapons and often have special rules governing their use. External Linear Frame: A linear frame worn and piloted, often using Interface Plugs. Incompatible with <X> Upgrade: The upgrade in question cannot be installed in the vehicle. Internal Linear Frame: A linear frame installed in the body as Cyberware. Personal Drone: A drone capable of operating without a NET Architecture. Requires CitiNet Access: The app or item in question will not function without a working CitiNet connection. With the Appearance of <X> Fashion: The armor in question is a type of Fashion and cannot be recog- nized as armor without a DV13 Wardrobe and Style Check or DV15 Perception Check. N ew Rule: Nomad Access n e w r u l e n om a d ac c e s Nomad Access is a new rule debuting in Black Chrome, designed to ensure Nomads will always have access to the coolest rides even as we introduce new vehicles to Cyberpunk RED. Nomad Access allows a Nomad to gain access to a vehicle with Nomad Access equal to their Moto Rank or lower whenever they would add a stock vehicle to their Family Motorpool via “leveling up” their Role’s Special Ability. The vehicle comes with all listed Upgrades. These Upgrades do not require additional Ranks of Moto to install. Unless otherwise stated, additional Upgrades can be added to the vehicle as per normal when the Nomad’s Moto Rank increases. Example: Stephanie just increased her Nomad’s Moto from Rank 4 to Rank 5. Browsing through Black Chrome, she likes the look of the Grundy, a truck that comes with armor and a combat plow standard. Better yet, the Nomad Access on it is 4, so she can grab it as her “one vehicle or upgrade” perk for leveling Moto. Later, she spends I.P. and increases her Nomad’s Moto from Rank 5 to Rank 6. Deciding her Grundy needs more firepower, she chooses a Vehicle Heavy Weapons Mount (see CP:R page 164) as her “one vehicle or upgrade” perk. Now her Grundy has a machine gun, too. Ho ho ho!

Hesitant to shoot it out in The Street? Want to hit them where it really hurts (their wallet)? Look no further than the Digital Gladiator app from Segotari! Designed for head-to-head play, the app links two Agents, allowing the users to duke it out in a virtual arena. The prize? The winner’s Agent is safe, while the loser’s Agent gets hit with a power surge, destroying it. If the loser was playing using Internal Agent Cyberware it also fries their brain. The cost of replacing an Agent makes Digital Gladiator an expensive hobby, encouraging the widespread trend of playing for money. But hey, it’s cheaper than dying in the street! Don’t waste ammo on a foolish grudge — waste their Agent instead with Digital Gladiator! App. To play, players must first create a Digital Gladiator: a Rank 4 Solo made using the Complete Package method (see CP:R page 78), with 62 STAT points, 86 Skill points, and 2,550eb to spend on whatever you want, except explosives. To be legal combatants, Gladiators must have a Humanity higher than 0. In Digital Gladiator matches, all purchased ammunition is restored at the end of a match, at which point the winner’s Gladiator is reset to its pre-match state. Gameplay is represented by a single combat encounter to the death between Solos, cannot be stopped once it has begun except through mutual decision of the players, and takes place in an arena of the GM’s design. The loser’s Agent is fried, destroying it beyond repair. If the loser played using an Internal Agent, they suffer the Brain Injury Critical Injury in addition to it being destroyed beyond repair.

Gangs roam the streets and, if worse comes to worst, the cops are too overworked to come to your aid unless you’ve got major eb. You’ve got to protect yourself! 4Tify transforms your Agent into a scanner to map out the weakest points in your doors, walls, and windows. Just scan your structural surfaces and you’ll know precisely where to reinforce your home to transform it into a fortress! App. Absolutely useless for its intended purpose but if a user spends 5 minutes scanning a section of cover with the app they gain +1d6 to the next damage done against it using this information. To perform a proper scan the user and their Agent must be within 1 m/yd of the cover for the entire 5 minutes. NCPD Crime Database NCPD 500eb (Expensive) The NCPD Crime Database links your Agent’s camera to the city’s crime records. The app allows the user to upload digital photos to the database, and then alerts the user if the people in the photo are wanted for any crimes, of any bounties on them, or if they have a criminal record. This process, which the app refers to as a records request, takes one hour to complete. The information it returns is limited to whatever the NCPD has publicly on file. NCPD has full access to the photograph and any embedded metadata. Following the NCPD’s release of their app, many other major cities have released similar apps using their own databases. App. Requires CitiNet access in Night City. It takes 1 hour for the app to return results.

So why spend your hard-earned money when you can just download Trauma Team MedScan to patch yourself up remotely? Simply snap a photo of your injury to be connected to a Trauma Team specialist who can walk you through simple medical procedures and ensure the highest quality in-home care. Trauma Team is not liable for any malpractice you may commit while using the app. App. Requires CitiNet access.

For 100eb, the specialist will stay connected for up to 1 hour after being paid and provide a +1 bonus to any First Aid or Paramedic Skill Check made to Stabilize a patient or perform a Quick Fix. For 500eb, a Trauma Team Remote Specialist can be paid through the app to guide the entire duration of a single 4-hour treatment, installation, bodysculpt, or surgery, providing a +1 bonus to the Medical Tech or Surgery Skill Check. A Trauma Team Executive subscriber can make use of this app at no additional cost once purchased, but access to the service may be terminated if misused. Ziggurat City Database Ziggurat 100eb (Premium) The Ziggurat City Database is a passion project of Vice President of User Experience and party legend Bastion D. Fashion. Rumor has it they made use of their wide range of carousing contacts to gather the information needed to fill the database through allegedly illicit means. The City Database is a one-stop shop for information about whatever city you are in at the time. From restaurants to concerts to sex workers, it covers it all. Each Ziggurat City Database covers a single city and must be purchased separately.

The net launcher holds 1 net in its magazine, and fires at 1 ROF using the Shoulder Arms Skill and the Shotgun Slug Range table, except that it cannot hit a target farther than 25 m/yds away. The net launcher can be successfully concealed without a Check and can be drawn and stowed without an Action. While the weapon is “popped up,” the user can’t hold any- thing in this arm’s hand. On a hit, the net grapples the target. Only one net can grapple a target at a time. While grappled by the net, the target cannot use their Move Action. The target in the net can’t make use of a weapon that requires two hands and takes a −2 to all phys- ical Actions for as long as they remain in the net. The net has 15 HP and is destroyed beyond repair when it reaches 0 HP. Firing a ranged weapon into a deployed net from outside of it will equally damage the net and the target grappled by it. Escaping the net requires a DV13 Contortionist Check, which can only be attempted by the target inside the net, or a DV13 Brawling Check which can be attempted by anyone. Succeeding at either of these destroys the net beyond repair. Replacement nets are 50eb (Costly) each.

With its ability to pump up the power and make instruments into weapons of mass destruction, the Sonic Boom is well known for its ability to blow speakers and shatter eardrums. This amplifier is a must-have for any hardcore metal band. All that power must come from somewhere, however, and the Sonic Boom requires a solid power source, otherwise it’s likely to blow a fuse halfway through the first riff. The owner’s manual suggests using a nuclear reactor to kick it up to eleven. When playing an instrument linked to this amp a user can take an Action to force everyone within 10 m/yards of a connected speaker to make a DV15 Resist Torture/Drugs Check. Anyone who fails suffers the Damaged Ear Critical Injury for 1 minute but does not take the Injury’s Bonus Damage. The Sonic Boom must be plugged into an active electrical outlet to function.

Created as the perfect speaker to pair with the KillStrom Amp, test footage shows it cracking concrete and rattling garbage cans as far away as the length of a football field. There is nothing wireless about the Typhoid. Something this powerful requires a hardline. Much like the KillStrom Amp, it also requires a decent power source. Once connected, the Typhoid brings the house down with ear-shattering sound. And unlike other super speakers, the Typhoid boasts enough dampeners to ensure the noise is as clear as a unicorn’s song and not just a blast of incoherent thunder. When connected to a KillStrom Typhoid Speaker, the DV of any Resist Torture/ Drugs Check caused by the KillsStrom Sonic Boom Amp (see page 40) is increased by 1, and the range of the Amp’s ability to cause a Resist Torture/ Drugs Check is increased by 90 m/yards. The Typhoid Speaker must be plugged into an active electrical outlet to function. Laser Light Electric Guitar Laser Light 1,000eb (Very Expensive) There is no show like one played on a Laser Light Electric Guitar. Lasers in the frets light up the strings, making them dance as the guitar is played. The head of the guitar is studded with six lasers programmed by default to mirror the strings, so even the back of the crowd can see the show. When linked to an Agent, the guitar’s settings are completely customizable, making it easy to create exactly the light show you want. This wireless guitar allows the artist to move freely around the stage but can also accept a hard connection if desired. A Laser Light Electric Guitar gives its user +1 to their Play Instrument (Guitar) Skill Checks. This bonus only applies once and won’t combine with other instruments that grant bonuses to the Play Instrument Skill. Additionally, this guitar counts as 1 installation of Light Tattoo Fashionware when worn openly, making it helpful for reaching the +2 Wardrobe and Style bonus for having 3 installations of Light Tattoo.

Hydrosubsidium Universal Aqualung Hydrosubsidium Inc. 5,000eb (Luxury) This donut-shaped neck device comes with two water filtration and conversion filters that pull oxygen from seawater and deliver it to the wearer’s mouth- piece. The Hydrosubsidium Universal Aqualung was originally designed with underwater labor in mind. The premise was to make oxygen tanks obsolete and allow for longer dive times. After initial testing, Hydrosubsidium found that the lung was more expensive to produce than they budgeted for, and the filtration system struggled due to pressure issues when diving. Instead of scrapping the product, Hydrosubsidium glamoured it up and released it as a recreational toy for the wealthy, complete with a high-pressure advertising campaign and big influencer endorsements to justify the obscene price point. A user wearing the Universal Aqualung can breathe water, as long as they are within 10 m/yards of the surface.

SecSystems offers a solution with their ChipVault: a rein- forced, moisture-free environment protected by the security of a biometric lock. EMP shielding safeguards your Chipware from those pesky microwavers, and the entire unit is as small as a deck of cards. It even floats in water! Peace of mind is now available at your local office supply store. The ChipVault holds up to 8 pieces of Chipware. Chipware stored inside the ChipVault cannot be rendered inoperable by EMP effects, like Microwaver pulses. Its biometric lock can be set up to accept a thumbprint, iris scan, blood sample, or any other desired biometric method. Such a lock cannot be unlocked without either its biometric key or a DV17 Electronics/Security Tech Check. Unfortunately, the ChipVault is also vulnerable due to an exposed hinge on the side of the device, a weakness that can easily be discovered and exploited with a DV10 Pick Lock Check. Doberman 500 Marking Scent KTech 50eb (Costly) It didn’t take long for security forces at SovOil to realize the benefits of the KTech Doberman 500’s Tracking Mode. It also didn’t take long for the dissi- dents they were tracking to engineer clever ways to throw the drone off their scent. Boosting the Doberman 500’s olfactory sensors wasn’t an option, so KTech developed a work around: a scent marker, undetectable to the baseline human nose, for the drone to lock onto. Referred to as “doberman piss” by some, this marking scent made it easy for SovOil security to mark protesters at rallies and then track them to their lairs at their leisure. Doberman 500 Marking Scent is a unique form of ammunition for the Air Pistol (see CP:R page 347). It does no damage but, instead, marks the target with a scent they can’t wash off except by dousing themselves in alcohol. The scent lasts 24 hours before wearing off naturally. Doberman 500 drones tracking a target marked with the scent gain a +4 to their Tracking Skill Check. Others with enhanced capabilities, such as biological bloodhounds and humans with Olfactory Boost chipware gain a +2 to their Tracking Skill Check when tracking a target marked with the scent. Comes in packs of 12.

This four-legged combat drone is designed to guard important people and deliver maximum punishment to anyone who dares to make a move against them. And unlike human employees, it can’t call in sick, take a bribe, or fall asleep on guard duty. Its initial design was much more robotic in appearance, but during the evaluation phase it was refined into a much more organic shape, partially at the request of marketing, who wanted it to be more appealing. During initial testing, many variations of onboard systems were tried but were determined to be too cumbersome and so removed. Without bulky weapons systems, once the Doberman started moving, it proved almost impossible to outrun. Pleased by the speed, the systems KTech ended up cramming into the final model were ones easily compacted and hidden in the drone’s lean frame. For SovOil, the KTech Doberman was everything they asked for and far more. As the last Corporate War started bleeding over into SovOil’s operations, they expanded their contract, allowing KTech to sell a limited number of to business partners within their umbrella, mainly as incentives for high-ranking Execs. Today, some of those drones have found their way to the open market. General Gear > SecurityGeneral Gear > Security Search 46 appsother categories cyberware fashion linear frames vehicles weapons Type Description Data Cost KTech Doberman 500 A medium-sized, four-legged combat drone. Equipped with the following: • Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon • Motion Detector • Olfactory Suite 8 MOVE•11SP•25HP Combat Number: 10 Roaming Range: 50 m/yds Cannot be countered 5,000eb (Luxury) Personal Drone. When purchased, a KTech Doberman 500 is linked to an Agent. Voluntarily linking it to a new Agent requires 5 uninterrupted minutes and both Agents must remain within 6 m/yds of the drone the entire time. Unlike other drones, the Doberman cannot be Countered using the Electronics/Security Tech Skill. The Doberman has three operation modes: Standby, Sentry, and Tracking. Switching modes does not require an Action. Standby Mode: In Standby Mode, the Doberman 500 is powered on but not operating. When in standby mode, the Doberman 500 cannot move, nor can it make or dodge attacks. Sentry Mode: In Sentry Mode, the Doberman 500 follows within 8 m/yds of its linked Agent, constantly scanning for threats to the user using its motion sensor, olfactory suite, and onboard programming. Use the Doberman 500’s Combat Number as its Perception Skill Base. The Doberman 500 can scan all open terrain within 50m/yds, including underwater, but not through cover. If it detects movement it does not register as an immediate threat, it signals with an electronic bark and a neon arrow on the chassis points in the correct direction. If the unit detects a threat to its user, it attacks immediately. Its bite is an Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. In combat, the Doberman 500 is controlled by the GM and prioritizes threats to its user before all else. At any time, the user can call for the Doberman 500 to break off and return using their Agent or a verbal command, without an Action. The Doberman cannot dodge ranged attacks in this mode and will not enter combat unless its programming identifies danger to its user. Tracking Mode: In Tracking Mode, the Doberman 500 can use its olfactory suite to track a specific scent, shared with it by its user. Presenting a scent to the Doberman 500 (in the form of an article of clothing or other item holding a target’s scent) requires an Action. The Doberman 500 tracks using its Combat Number as its Tracking Skill Base. The user can always call the Doberman 500 back to it using their Agent or a verbal command without an Action. The Doberman cannot make attacks while in Tracking Mode but will dodge Melee attacks. It cannot dodge ranged attacks in this mode. The Doberman never travels more than 50 m/yds away from its user, no matter its mode. If switched to Sentry Mode, it prioritizes returning to within 8 m/yds away from its user over combat farther away. If in Tracking Mode, it never travels further than 50 m/yds away from the user, stopping and waiting for them to catch up or call it back. Each unit has 48 hours of energy before it must charge for an hour in the sun or at an outlet.

Its streamlined build is designed for comfortable concealment in either position. When used to conceal a weapon already capable of concealment under clothing, the RapiDeploy Sheath grants the user a +2 to their Conceal/Reveal Object Skill Check. If a RapiDeploy Sheath would be destroyed beyond repair, it is instead simply destroyed. Additionally, if a RapiDeploy Sheath would be destroyed, but not beyond repair, it is instead left entirely unscathed. Streetcase by SecSystems SecSystems 500eb (Expensive) Part of the ExecAttire line, the Streetcase by SecSystems has everything you need to survive the corporate ladder, with ample room inside for your import- ant papers, a laptop computer, a holster for a Heavy Pistol, a removable ChipVault, and a smoke screen which activates at the touch of a button. And yes, like all products in the ExecAttire line, it floats! A specially designed holster located on the outside of the Streetcase can store an easily accessible Heavy Pistol. Drawing the Heavy Pistol from the Streetcase does not take an Action. Inside the Streetcase, there is just enough space for a laptop computer, a ChipVault (see page 44, included with purchase), and a single Smoke Grenade (one included with purchase). As an Action, while holding the handle of the suitcase, the user can detonate the Smoke Grenade at their position, which causes the grenade to drop to the ground below through a hatch. Instead of a typical Heavy Pistol, a ModFire 10x (see page 114, not included) and all of its spare parts can also fit into the case, as long as the ModFire 10x is stored in its Heavy Pistol mode. When stored in this manner, the ModFire 10x is easily accessible.

Crafted from AW-003 nylon, their One Touch Habitat (OTH) can withstand extreme climates and boasts a durable carbon composite frame. Each OTH comes with a built-in environmental control system that offers both heating and air conditioning, depending on the outside temperature. True to its name, to set up the One Touch Habitat, all a person must do is unlock the side latches on the carrying case, place it on the ground, and push a button. The OTH then sets itself up using a series of internal springs. Next time you take the family camping, think only once, think One Touch! The One Touch Habitat provides protection from Exposure to Extreme Elements (see CP:R page 181). Sleeping in a One Touch Habitat counts as Sleeping in the Wilderness (see CP:R, page 377) unless you are camping in the city, in which case it counts as Sleeping on the Street. Additionally, sleeping in a One Touch Habitat with more than 2 people is considered Being Crammed (see CP:R, page 377). Deploying/undeploying the One Touch Habitat requires an Action.

Any organic material can be fed into the machine for processing. This means hay, grass, leaves, squirrels, woodchips, and more! The machine then breaks down the organic material using nano-technology to draw out any favorable nutrients. After ten minutes it prints a series of (usually) green wafers. Despite somehow tasting worse than Kibble these wafers are filling and nutritious. Using a Mr. Biscuit, a group of up to 10 people can survive without paying for a Lifestyle so long as they live in a location with an Outskirts Threat Rating. There isn’t enough organic material to feed a Mr. Biscuit regularly inside a city. Petrochem Nitro Ultra9 Petrochem 100eb (Premium) When the fuel gauge sits on E and there isn’t a station for miles, break out a canister of Ultra9 to fill up your tank in an instant. This highly volatile chemical blend charged by ethanol molecularity reacts instantly with air to create a fume-based fuel. Unfortunately, this revolutionary road savior is a little too efficient after its initial reaction with the air and runs the vehicle’s engine super- hot — hot enough to cause the engine to explode in the event of sudden impact (aka a crash). Most people ignore the negative press, especially gang members who don’t mind blowing up a ride they’ve just jacked. A canister of Nitro Ultra9 can be poured into a vehicle’s CHOOH 2 tank as an Action to instantly refill it. Typically, you can’t access the vehicle’s tank without being able to start the vehicle yourself. For 24 hours after a canister of Nitro Ultra9 is poured into the tank, whenever the vehicle rams something or is rammed by something which would cause the vehicle to take 6d6 damage, it instead takes 12d6 damage. Additionally, for these 24 hours, the vehicle is considered to have a MOVE of 5 higher than its standard Combat Speed. Narrative Speed is unaffected.

As they struggled to keep communications afloat, their R&D depart- ment devised ways to link cities and long-distance networks using something similar to weather balloons. Unfortunately, a single unit simply wasn’t capable of handling the amount of data necessary to serve as a link between cities, so project funding and scope were slashed until the remaining skeleton crew released a much smaller unit than was originally imagined to little fanfare. The WorldSat Aerial Sphere (WSAS) comes in a compact plastic box, crammed full of a small helium cartridge, control unit, two stakes, a spool of high tensile wire, and an inflatable balloon with a solar panel layer and transmission webbing. To use the WSAS, simply inflate the balloon, attach the wire, and let it rise. While it’s ascending, activate the control unit and hit the on switch. When the balloon is high enough to link to a communications tower, lock the wire spool and you’ll have made a connection to the closest CitiNet that’s just strong enough to get the job done. The WorldSat Aerial Sphere takes 1 hour to set up. Once set up, it cannot be moved without first being deconstructed, which also takes 1 hour. While set up, the WorldSat Aerial Sphere provides a connection to a CitiNet so long as you are within 50 miles (80 km) of it or another Aerial Sphere with a connection. You must be within 100m/yds of the control unit to access the CitiNet. Should the wire (with 10 HP) tethering the balloon to the ground be cut, service terminates immediately and the Aerial Sphere is destroyed beyond repair.

The bastard child of an off-roader and a mili- tary vehicle that dreamed of being a muscle car when it grew up, the Chupacabra is one hell of a racer with the four-wheel drive to back it up. A monster on and off the road, you don’t want to be behind one when the turbo kicks in and sprays mud out the back tires like a Biotechnica-engineered killer whale at the Night City Aquarium. The one thing it’s missing is what most modern punks want: gadgets. Made of refurbished trucks, muscle cars, and ancient, recycled technology most Chupacabras don’t even have digital dials in the dashboard, and many sport parts easily twice as old as their drivers. Despite this, the Chupacabra still shines like brand new. It’s a muscle machine, and that never goes out of style. Getting your hands on one isn’t always easy. Diego Motors, a Nomad oper- ation run by an offshoot of the Jode family, operates all over South America but not in North America. It’s far easier to call a Fixer with Jode contacts than track the company down, although it would be worth the trip if you did. The Chupacabra is a Compact Groundcar with NOS, a Seating Upgrade, and a Heavy Chassis.

These Nomads have a natural talent for making custom trikes. Each piece is hand- crafted and forged, carefully assembled, and finished with a wax job you could shave with. Each trike is a work of sturdy and reliable moving art. That’s why, when you want one, getting your hands on it isn’t easy. It’s far easier to call a Fixer than to track down the Jode Caravan carrying a shipment of Diego Motors offerings, although it would certainly be worth the trip. If you fancy getting hold of the Diego Motors Caravan yourself, prepare for quite the ride before you actually get to ride. The Diego Motors Range Trike is a Roadbike with three seats, an Armored Chassis, and a Heavy Chassis. It is incompatible with the Seating Upgrade.

They started by pulling all the armor plating they had and stacking it in one part of their yard. They then pulled all the fully functional truck engines and placed them in a different section. By the time they finished, Grundy Salvage had organized enough material to begin manufacturing their own vehicles. Building transportation out of scrap metal wasn’t that difficult but marketing them was. Luckily, one of the Grundy brothers was a former SovOil operator. He contacted some of his former buddies and soon Grundy Salvage was shipping the “Grundy” to warzones across Europe and beyond. Built entirely from scrap in a Polish scrapyard, the Grundy is a fully functional truck engine set in a durable frame, plated with myriad metals — a mobile bunker rolling on four sturdy tires. When you live in a Combat Zone, you likely don’t need much else but every Grundy also sports a fantastically useful combat plow to make up for the lack of bulletproof glass on the vehicle, as the driver can easily drive through the building in which their attacker is taking cover. The Grundy is a Compact Groundcar with a Heavy Chassis, Armored Chassis, and a Combat Plow.

But it was this feature of its design that also drove sales. As they grew in popularity, it became standard for owners to take their Harvey 100 apart and customize it. Wanting to expand its market, AmeriCar released a more “feminine” rede- sign dubbed the Harriet 100. This variant came with “fashion-forward parts”, and saddlebags, further fueling the obsession with Harvey customization. Edgerunners also found a use for the Harvey by stuffing it full of weapons. The Harvey 100 is a Roadbike. Nomad Access: 1 The Harriet 100 is a Roadbike with a Smuggling Upgrade. Nomad Access: 2 The Harvey Merc is a Roadbike with an Onboard Machine Gun and Onboard Rocket Pod.

The bike drives like a low-rider, with a sleek canopy sliding over the driver to create a self-contained environment — bulletproof, of course — or retracted for an open-air experience. The Artemis can convert to “race mode” at the touch of a button, which pushes the seat to a configuration seen commonly on race bikes and supercharges the engine, but which the bike cannot sustain indefinitely without damage — usually long enough to win the race, though. The Highway Master Artemis is a Roadbike with an Armored Chassis. With an Action, the driver can engage or retract the canopy, which fully encloses the cabin behind two Bulletproof Glass Upgrades. Additionally, the driver can use an Action to supercharge the bike, causing it to act as if it was a Superbike in terms of both Combat and Narrative Speed for up to 10 minutes. Using this feature twice within the same day destroys the bike at the end of the second 10-minute supercharge.

The Volkhov is most often associated with SovOil security forces, who make heavy use of the vehicle, but is also found in the hands of Eastern European military groups and dissidents. Equipped with a heavy weapons mount, the Volkhov isn’t an uncommon sight on Soviet battlefields. The interior of the Volkhov comes standard with comfortable padded seating, a median-quality radio, and LED dashboard gauges. The Volkov also comes with floorboard and dash heating for those cold Russian nights and a shoddy air conditioner — but where you need a Volkov, you probably won’t notice. The Volkov is a Compact Groundcar with a Heavy Chassis, Armored Chassis, and a Vehicle Heavy Weapon Mount with a Techtronika Russia BMG-500 (see page 122) attached.

Most Ebi are owned by Corporate carpoolers who are too poor for aerodynes or luxury vehi- cles but who still want the status boost of owning a car. Small families enjoy these hatchbacks as well, especially the feature where the car says hello and goodbye as you enter and exit. The Ebi wasn’t designed for speed and the chassis is mostly plastic, so driving it into the Combat Zone would be a bad idea. The Ebi is a Compact Groundcar with 35 SDP.

The Zac’s chunky tires, reinforced chassis, and excellent clearance are all tuned to handle the daily life of its main customers: the Nomads. The interior of its sleeping compartment is adorned with synthetic leather upholstery, utilitarian furnishings, and a bed comfortable enough for a life of long and dusty road trips.

First released a decade ago, the JetBoy quickly became popular among young gangers. Who needs an expensive motorcycle when a hoverboard is far cheaper and — frankly — cooler? This hoverboard moves utilizing two turbines built into the deck, con- trolled by balancing and adjusting foot pressure. An intake vent on the front of the board provides a counterbalance for the heavy motor and doubles as a cooling feature. The highlight for most teenagers is JetBoy’s killer sound system that easily links to their Agent. This feature is also the most common complaint concerned citizens have raised about the JetBoy. Even in places with a ban in place, law enforcement often finds they have much better and less dangerous things to do than chase down armed teenagers on hoverboards. The JetBoy is a Land Vehicle with 10 SDP (HP) and only one seat that hovers just above the ground. It can always be driven with no hands as if the user had connected Interface Plugs. You make maneuvers on the JetBoy using the Athletics Skill. Basic movement does not require a minimum Skill Base. It provides 15 MOVE in combat, and has a Narrative Speed of 30 MPH (48 KPH).

This spherical explosive is filled with a highly flexible and sticky solution. Thirty seconds after exposure to oxygen, the solution takes on a rubbery consistency that remains sticky, making it almost impossible for anyone to move while covered in the material. So, when the Arachnid goes off, it makes a major mess. The Arachnid’s round design and purple chrome casing make it instantly recognizable in combat situations. The Arachnid is great for parties, prisons, and riots, with webbing in many fun colors. The CE Arachnid may be pur- chased at any Centurion Essentials kiosk or licensed retailer. This is Grenade Ammunition. It can be loaded into a Grenade Launcher or thrown. Anyone hit by the grenade takes no damage but is covered by the Arachnid solution. Targets covered that do not take an Action to douse them- selves in alcohol within the 30-second arming period (10 rounds in combat) or who are not covered in alcohol by someone else taking an Action to do so are grappled by it when it comes online. While grappled by the solution, targets cannot use their Move Action. Targets also can’t make use of a weapon that requires two hands and take −2 to all Actions for as long as they remain grappled. The webbing solution surrounding a single target has 15 HP and is destroyed beyond repair when it reaches 0 HP. Firing a ranged weapon into an activated solution from outside of it deals damage to both the webbing and the person grappled by it. Destroying and escaping the webbing requires a DV15 Brawling Check that can be attempted by anyone within melee range. 87 Search appsother categories cyberware fashion general gear linear frames vehicles Weapons > Explosives Shuriken Tornado Grenade Great Lakes Cutlery 100eb (Premium) When Great Lakes Cutlery decided to get into the arms business, they did it with the Shuriken Tornado. This pineapple-style grenade is packed tightly with stacked shuriken and high-powered electromagnets. The base is weighted, so it always lands in a perfect standing position. Once activated and thrown, as the grenade lands and rests, the electromagnet activates, sending twenty shuriken exploding outward at high velocity. The force is so great the shuriken penetrate concrete and shred flesh and bone. The grenade gets the “tornado” in its name from the aftermath of the detonation since it looks like one hit the area. This is Grenade Ammunition and does damage like an Armor Piercing Grenade. It can be loaded into a Grenade Launcher or thrown. Unlike with other explo- sions, the damage dealt by the Shuriken Tornado is rolled separately for each target damaged by it. Whenever damage caused by this grenade causes the Foreign Object Critical Injury, the victim rolls again on the Critical Injury table until they roll a Critical Injury that isn’t Foreign Object. The victim then suffers that Critical Injury as well. This second injury deals no Bonus Damage. GunMart Door Cracker GunMart Inc. 50eb (Costly) The GunMart Door Cracker is a cheap explosive device made for hard entry. The bomb itself is 1 inch (2.54 cm) in diameter and 1 inch (2.54 cm) thick. The base is magnetic with sticky tape around its edges in case the door (or wall or whatever) isn’t metal. GunMart Door Crackers are popular with police and gangs alike and priced cheaply enough to be affordable to both. This is an Explosive. It takes 30 seconds (10 Rounds in combat) to set up on a 2 m/yd by 2 m/yd section of cover and arm. This can be reduced to 1 Action with a DV15 Demolitions Check, which can only be attempted once. Once armed, it can be detonated with an Action, via a dedicated deto- nation switch or a paired Agent. Upon detonation, the 2 m/yd by 2 m/yd section of cover, and only that section of cover, takes 6d6 damage.

All units are rigged with a thirty-second timer that begins the countdown once the device is submerged entirely in liquid. The device then superheats, causing the bottle and its contents to explode vio- lently. The resulting explosion sprays ultra-hot fluids and steam over everything in the blast radius. The Micro Hydrogen Combustor is popular with burgling Netrunners and covert operators. Just one can create a hell of a distraction. This is an Explosive. The Hydrosubsidium Micro Hydrogen Combustor explodes like an Armor Piercing Grenade 30 seconds (10 Rounds in combat) after it is submerged entirely in liquid.

Law enforcement and intelligence agencies have been looking for the original source of the KillChip for the years with no luck. By now, thousands of KillChips have flooded the streets, making the technology easy to reverse-engineer. This is an Explosive. A KillChip is an explosive standard memory chip that only detonates when plugged into Chipware Socket Neuralware. The unlucky person who inserts one into their head immediately takes 6d6 damage directly to their HP (armor does not reduce it) and suffers the Brain Injury Critical Injury.

In other words, one SovOil security trooper standing on the deck outside the bridge can pop these babies out of a grenade launcher at mobs of pirates below all day and not worry about hurting the company’s profit margins. This is Grenade Ammunition. It can be loaded into a Grenade Launcher or thrown. It is an Armor Piercing Grenade that deals 5d6 damage to targets but causes no damage to cover. OUTLet Explosive 100eb (Premium) An OUTLet Explosive looks just like a standard outlet adapter, but it’s actually a small yet powerful micro-explosive. When plugged into a wall socket the OUTLet can be set to detonate via a remote trigger. The explosive burns hot and, in most cases, makes it look like victims died due to an electrical fire. It was only after a hit in Night City that a fire investigator realized the true nature of the OUTLet. When word got out, dozens of murder investigations were re-opened worldwide. This is an Explosive disguised as an outlet adapter. It takes 30 seconds (10 rounds in combat) to arm. This can be reduced to 1 Action with a DV15 Demolitions Check, which can only be attempted once. Once armed, it can be detonated as if it were an Armor Piercing Grenade with an Action, via a dedicated remote detonation switch or a paired Agent.

To use TR-4, all one must do is pour the fluid into a fuel tank, where it mixes with the CHOOH 2. When the vehicle starts, the mix flows to the engine where it fires and deto- nates. TR-4 is completely undetectable without full chemical analysis and has no smell. The detonator fluid was originally manufactured by Yakuza-funded scientists to create a new method of assassinating enemies. The fluid has since been reverse-engineered and almost any chemical Tech can create a batch. This is an Explosive. TR-4 Detonator Fluid is a vial of pale yellow liquid which must be first poured into a vehicle’s CHOOH 2 tank to arm it. Doing this takes 30 seconds (10 rounds in combat). This can be reduced to 1 Action with a DV15 Demolitions Check, which can only be attempted once. Typically, you can’t access the vehicle’s tank without being able to start the vehicle yourself. Once mixed in, the next time the vehicle is started, the gas tank explodes like an Armor Piercing grenade.

Arasaka also sells a line of fluids of the exact viscosity required by the blade’s mechanism in pressurized, branded cylinders. Currently available are Arasaka Fire, Arasaka Acid, and Arasaka Wound Salt but others are in development. The blade’s pommel allows for easy reloading of the three chambers inside the grip. The Arasaka Weeping Reaver is an Excellent Quality Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. Once per minute (20 Combat Rounds), as an Action, the user can direct the Weeping Reaver to coat itself with one or more fluids loaded into its handle. Multiple applications of the same fluid do nothing, but up to three different fluids can be combined at once as the user desires. Each fluid remains effective for 1 minute after application. Each fluid canister contains a single application and only fluids designed for use with the Weeping Reaver have any effect. The Weeping Reaver contains three chambers for storing fluid canisters. Reloading any combination of these chambers takes an Action. Each canister costs 100eb (Premium). When coated with Arasaka Fire, whenever a user deals damage to a target through their armor, they ignite the target. Until the target spends an Action to put themselves out, they take 2 damage to their HP whenever they end their Turn. Multiple instances of this effect cannot stack. When coated with Arasaka Acid, the Weeping Reaver ablates armor by 2 instead of 1 whenever it would ablate armor. When coated with Arasaka Wound Salt, whenever the weapon causes the Foreign Object Critical Injury, the victim rolls again on the Critical Injury table until they roll a Critical Injury that isn’t Foreign Object. The victim then suffers that Critical Injury as well. This second injury deals no Bonus Damage.

Behind its nearly invisible molecular-thin orbital crystal edge, in its 2,000-times-a-minute vibrating heart lies a truth: that Kendachi designed the Mono-Katana for exactly what all swords are ulti- mately designed for — killing. It simply does it better. The carnage caused by these swords has been the fodder of Edgerunner stories for decades, and for good reason. If you hear one of these weapons hum to life, you’re unlikely to survive long enough to hear another. This is a Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. With the correct biometric key, damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target’s armor entirely if it is lower than SP7. Armor with SP7 or higher is still interacted with as normal. In the hands of a user without the correct biometric key, the weapon will not vibrate, leaving it only a Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon.

Hundreds of thousands of green “Mono-Katanas”, each a replica of the blade wielded by the show’s protagonist, were made and distributed just in time to sit in warehouses and on cargo ships thanks to the 4th Corporate War. This is a Poor Quality Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. To the untrained eye, it appears to be an actual green Kendachi Mono-Katana, requiring a DV13 Perception or Weaponstech Check to notice the difference. Despite the blade’s name, it is a cheap collectible and has none of the bio- metric security or armor-bypassing features of a true Mono-Katana.Pick-up or Browse at Booth C4 93 Search appsother categories cyberware fashion general gear linear frames vehicles Kendachi Mono-Wakizashi Kendachi 1,000eb (V Expensive) Due to its short length, a Mono-Wakizashi is the sen- sible choice of many sword-wielding Edgerunners, as it is easy to carry indoors, fits nicely in your vehicle, and is comfortable to carry in crowds. When active, a Mono-Wakizashi is the quietest semi-transparent vibrating orbital crystal monoblade on the market, approximately three times quieter than a Mono- Katana, and twenty times quieter than a Mono-Three. Recently, some have noticed that its pitched hissing resembles that of a praying mantis, which has led to a slew of new nicknames. This is a One-Handed Exotic Heavy Melee Weapon. With the correct biometric key, damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target’s armor entirely if it is lower than SP7. Armor with SP7 or higher is still interacted with as normal. In the hand of a user without the correct biometric key, the weapon will not vibrate, leaving it only a One-Handed Exotic Heavy Melee Weapon.

This tanto is equipped with a high-solar cell stored in the handle, which should never need recharging unless you plan on stabbing/shocking more than a hundred people on a cloudy day. When the tang of the blade strikes organic material, it delivers a nasty shock, adding insult to injury. This tanto can be found in the hands of Execs and Fixers who need a concealable personal defense solution. As a result of an overly optimistic production run dozens of these blades can be found drifting around the Night Markets of various North American cities. The White Hornet is a One-Handed Exotic Medium Melee Weapon that can be concealed. If damage dealt by it would reduce a target to under 1 HP, they can be instead be left Unconscious at 1 HP if the wielder so chooses.

When the Execs at SovOil saw it, however, they assumed otherwise and ordered it churned out as part of a limited production run. The blade of the Kleaver is powered by a large motor in the handle to both vibrate the blade 2,000 times per minute and super heat it to an unholy temperature, making it the exact opposite of an efficient and rational design. When uncharged, the Rostović Kleaver is a Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon that requires BODY 11 or higher to wield. Charging the weapon begins with an Action, which starts a 1-minute-long (20 rounds in combat) heating process, during which the blade must be wielded, or it will melt itself into any surface it’s left touching, destroying the weapon. Starting the heating process also requires the blade be loaded with three fresh 50eb (Costly) battery packs, which get as hot as the length of the blade during the heating process, destroying them beyond repair. As a safety feature, you can only reload these battery packs while the blade is uncharged, which takes an Action. After the heating process is complete, the blade begins to vibrate automatically. Once charged, the Rostović Kleaver will remain charged for exactly 5 minutes. While charged, the Kleaver is a Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon, which deals 5d6 damage that requires BODY 11 or higher to wield. While charged, damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target’s armor entirely if it is lower than SP11. Armor with SP11 and higher is still interacted with as normal. Additionally, anyone or anything hit by the Kleaver is now Mildly On Fire (see CP:R page 180). If the Kleaver is unequipped while charged, it will melt itself into any surface it’s left touching, destroying the weapon. Thirty seconds before time is up, the battery compartment begins to smoke. Due to its massive size, this Kleaver cannot be wielded in a single hand by any means.

Enter Zhirafa’s Rhinocefist, a cheap-to-produce, cheap-to- maintain exoskeleton arm modified by advanced hydraulics already found in construction equipment. This provides greatly enhanced strength to the wearer while remaining compatible with the same Interface Plug installation construction workers are already accustomed to for operating heavy machinery. Resembling a segmented armored gauntlet covering the user’s entire arm and shoulder, the Rhinocefist straps to the body with cross-chest and back supports. It is typically worn under clothing with a sleeve torn off to accommodate the exoskeleton. The Rhinocefist provides greatly enhanced demolition power and can double as a hydraulic ram when the “horn” is locked in place. By reusing many of the same parts found in frequently salvaged construction equipment, Zhirafa was able to both save on production costs and create an easy to maintain product. When worn over an arm and connected to a user via Interface Plugs, Brawling attacks made using the Rhinocefist by the user always deal 4d6 damage, regardless of the User’s BODY. As an Action, the Rhinocefist can be converted to and from an Excellent Quality Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon, but while in this mode the user can’t hold anything in that arm’s hand. Due to its bulk, any options stored in a Cyberarm or meat arm wearing the Rhinocefist are inacces- sible. Putting on the Rhinocefist and taking it off is an Action, part of which can include connecting/disconnecting Interface Plugs. The Rhonocefist cannot be concealed. Due to its unique design, repairing a destroyed Rhinocefist can be done with either a DV13 Weaponstech or Land Vehicle Tech Check, and takes only 6 hours. On a failed Check, halfway through the repair, you realize that you have to start the repair from scratch.

When the button is pressed down, the wire flicks out light- ning-fast before perfectly and safely retracting again. Branded as the Mono- Guard, Kendachi markets this monowhip as a defensive weapon designed for bodyguards. However, assassins are the real target market for this weapon since it is easy to conceal and whisper quiet. Some Execs like to carry a Mono-Guard, because it’s dangerous, fits nicely in a suit pocket, and is, from their perspective, affordable. The Mono-Guard is a One-Handed Exotic Heavy Melee Weapon that can be concealed. When using this weapon, whenever you cause the Foreign Object Critical Injury, the victim rolls again on the Critical Injury table until they roll a Critical Injury that isn’t Foreign Object and suffers that Critical Injury instead. Faisal’s Magna Knuckles Faisal’s Customs 1,000eb (V Expensive) A knuckle duster modified with an electromagnetic pulse system that triggers whenever it makes repeated impact, powered by a battery pack hidden in the weapon’s palm rest. Designed by renowned Tech Faisal Farah specifically for use in pit fighting, the chance to see a combatant perform a rare upset against a borderline cyberpsycho opponent with these has made them a crowd favorite. This is a One-Handed Exotic Medium Melee Weapon. Anyone hit twice by this 2 ROF weapon in a single combat Turn must try to beat a DV15 Cybertech Check. If they fail, the GM chooses two pieces of their cyberware to become inoperable for one minute. Cyberlimbs rendered inoperable act as their meat counterparts do when they have been dismembered but still hang loosely. Whenever this weapon causes a target to make this Check it drains one of the 8 charges in the weapon’s easily rechargeable (1 hour) 50eb (Costly) battery pack. Without any charges, this weapon still functions as a One-Handed Exotic Medium Melee Weapon.

To zap a target, the user simply smacks them with the easily retractable baton to release a powerful and (usually) less-than-lethal shock. To microwave a target, the user aims their forearm in the direction of the target and tenses the muscles in their hand to fire. An efficient design, both sides of the weapon run off the same easily rechargeable eight-shot 50eb battery pack, which loads smoothly into the lower forearm of the weapon. The Bouncer is a One-Handed Exotic Combination Stun Baton and Microwaver (see CP:R, pg. 348), both of which drain a charge from the weapon’s easily rechargeable (1 hour) 50eb (Costly) eight-shot battery pack with each swing/pulse. When the battery is fully drained, neither mode of the weapon can be used to attack. Putting on a Bouncer and taking one off is an Action. The Bouncer cannot be installed into popup cyberware or concealed by any means. Any non-Cy- berfinger cyberware options (except Scratchers and Rippers) stored in a Cyberhand or meat hand the Bouncer is being worn over are inaccessible while the Bouncer is worn.

The blade initially deploys with such force that it can easily shatter glass, which was one of the elements required by marketing during the design phase. This makes it an excellent tool for entry, escape, and rescue and a perfect defensive weapon. For the blade to be retracted, a lock mechanism in the palm must be released and the blade slowly pushed back into place (usually by pressing it against a solid surface). The FangFist was originally produced for SovOil, but the Megacorp refused to take delivery, so tens of thousands of units have promptly flooded Night Markets around the world. The FangFist gloves come in black, camouflage, indigo, and urban camouflage. The FangFist is an Excellent Quality One-Handed Exotic Medium Melee Weapon stored within a specially designed glove. On the Turn where the FangFist is drawn, and on that Turn only, it acts as an Excellent Quality One- Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. The FangFist’s ROF on the Turn it is deployed is 1. While the blade is extended, the gloved hand cannot be used to do anything else. Any cyberware stored in the hand which the glove is being worn over cannot be accessed while the glove is worn. Retracting the blade back into the glove is an Action, as is putting the glove on or taking it off. While the blade is retracted, the glove can be concealed with the Conceal/ Reveal Object Skill under clothing, for example, worn underneath a long sleeve jacket. If worn openly people can easily tell what it is.

When needed, the user can trigger the blades to pop out by making a fist to activate a mechanism in the palm. The weapon was initially produced by SlamDance exclusively for SovOil, who commissioned it as a tool of terror in their conflicts against rebel forces. Named after the Tasmanian devil, the weapon is lightweight, easy to use, and, most importantly, absolutely terrifying to be on the receiving end of. The reverse side of the blades are hooked and micro-textured to make them ideal implements of intimidation. The SlamDance Tasmanskiy Klô is an Excellent Quality Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon that comes permanently installed in a Battleglove from which it can be drawn and stowed without an Action. While the blade is drawn, that hand cannot be used to do anything else. When the Klô is used to threaten someone, the user gets a +2 to their Interrogation Skill Check. The Battleglove which houses the claw has a single Option Slot for a Cyberlimb or Cyberarm option. The cost to purchase and install a Cyberlimb or Cyberarm option into the Battleglove’s single Option Slot is the same cost as doing so in a Cyberarm. Any options stored in a Cyberarm or meat arm wearing the Battleglove are inaccessible while the Battleglove is being worn. Putting on the Klô and taking it off is an Action.

The thrower simply locks onto a target using Targeting Scope cyberware, gives the Ranger a good toss in the right direction, and the boomerang guides itself toward the target, and then back to the thrower. The Ranger boasts razor-sharp blades on its leading and returning edges that retract automatically before landing in the thrower’s hand. This is a One-Handed Exotic Heavy Melee Weapon but cannot be used to make a melee attack. Unlike a typical melee weapon not designed for throw- ing, this weapon continues to halve SP when thrown. Additionally, throwing this weapon counts as half of a 2 ROF attack. After it is thrown, at the beginning of your next Turn, assuming you have Targeting Scope Cyberware, it returns to you, wherever you may be on the battlefield. You may choose to catch it without an Action if you have a hand free to do so. Otherwise, it lands on the ground somewhere nearby as chosen by the GM.

A savior of the modern survivalist, the design of the Utility Tomahawk offers a smooth throw and powerful leverage. The blade and pick are hard to dull and the tool carries the weight needed for the crowbar hilt to do serious damage. The tool is popular with survivalists and special forces who deploy in environmentally extreme theaters but has also found a home with some emergency responders, who use it primarily to pry open doors. This is a One-Handed Exotic Heavy Melee Weapon. Unlike a typical melee weapon not designed for throwing, this weapon continues to halve SP when thrown. Kendachi Mono-Star Kendachi 500eb (Expensive) From the minds of Kendachi comes the Mono-Star. A mono-shuriken, its ball-bearing center conceals a tiny solar/kinetic-capture power cell that hums while the star spins up between the fingers of the wielder. In a second, the weapon is spinning at full speed and begins to vibrate, meaning the weapon is live and ready to use. Some combatants like to use the Mono-Star up close and personal, cutting arteries, while others appreciate the value of a classic thrown shuriken. The Mono-Star is a One-Handed Exotic Medium Melee Weapon that can be concealed. Unlike a typical melee weapon not designed for throwing, this weapon continues to halve SP when thrown. Additionally, throwing this weapon counts as half of a 2 ROF attack. When thrown, whenever you cause the Foreign Object Critical Injury, the victim rolls again on the Critical Injury table until they roll a Critical Injury that isn’t Foreign Object and suffers that Critical Injury in addition to the Foreign Object Critical Injury.

However, by the time they had produced a batch of prototypes and shipped them off for hands-on testing in Tokyo the project had to be shelved due to their workshop in the Night CIty’s Arasaka Tower annihilation via nuclear fire. Most versions of the AVAR found in the wild are missing at least one of the two needed conversion parts for the railgun mode. To convert the weapon, the normal receiver is switched out with an electromagnetic one and the barrel is switched out with a heat-resistant one. While this change locks the weapon out of autofire and makes it less accurate, it is made up for by the railgun mode’s armor-piercing capability. The Arasaka Variable Assault Rifle is an Excellent Quality Exotic Assault Rifle with a unique alternate fire railgun mode. Assuming you have both needed conversion parts, you can switch between its standard and special railgun variant mode when combat begins (before Initiative is rolled), anytime outside of combat, or in combat with an Action. In its special railgun mode, the weapon is incapable of Autofire and Aimed Shots, but damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target’s armor entirely if it is lower than SP7. Armor with SP7 or higher is still interacted with as normal. Additionally, whenever fired in its railgun mode, a charge is drained from the weap- on’s eight-shot rechargeable (1 hour) 50eb (Costly) battery pack in addition to a bullet being fired from the magazine. The battery pack can be reloaded separately from the gun’s magazine with an Action. If fired in railgun mode without any charges in its battery pack, or without a properly installed battery pack, the weapon fires instead as a typical Excellent Quality Exotic Assault Rifle. The 15,000eb price point of the weapon assumes that it comes with both of its conversion parts. For each missing part in an AVAR at the time of sale, the price is lowered by 5,000eb. Individual conversion parts and the base weapon are worth 5,000eb (Luxury) when sold alone. 103 Search appsother categories cyberware fashion general gear linear frames vehicles Eagletech Survivalist Eagletech 500eb (Expensive) The Eagletech Survivalist is a combination rifle and crossbow rolled into one impressive piece of kit. The bow components are built into the middle section of the assault rifle, giving the weapon the appearance of a larger crossbow. The rifle barrel runs above and parallel to the arrow track, allowing for faster firing. Arrows are loaded directly into the arrow track, which automatically draws them back. The ammo clip for the assault rifle slides into the stock of the weapon to cut down on weight. The Eagletech Survivalist was originally marketed to hunters and wilderness guides, and it initially sold only modestly. Sales picked up as ammunition shortages struck the northern territories of the Americas, leading more Nomads and other wilderness types to turn to reliable crossbows to solve their lack-of-bullet woes. Nowadays, you can find many of these weapons second-hand floating around the Night Markets. The Survivalist is an Exotic Combination Crossbow and Assault Rifle. The Assault Rifle mode is incapable of Autofire, only has 10 shots in its magazine, and is fired with the Archery Skill instead of Shoulder Arms despite firing bullets. Both modes of this weapon benefit from the weapon’s integrated Sniping Scope and can load Non-Basic Ammunition despite being Exotic Weapons.

The nets are durable and a pain in the ass to get out of once they make impact because of a barbed hooking system that locks into place after it wraps a target. The Dead or Alive is a Poor Quality Exotic Shotgun with an integrated Poor Quality Net Launcher that cannot be removed. The net launcher holds two nets in its magazine, and fires at 1 ROF using the Shoulder Arms Skill and the Shotgun Slug Range table, except that it cannot hit a target further than 25 m/yds away. On a hit, the net grapples the target. Only one net can grapple a target at a time. While grappled by the net, the target cannot use their Move Action. The target in the net can’t make use of a weapon that requires two hands and takes a −2 to all physical Actions for as long as they remain in the net. The net has 15 HP and is destroyed beyond repair when it reaches 0 HP. Firing a ranged weapon into a deployed net from outside of it will equally damage the net and the target grappled by it. Escaping the net requires a DV13 Contortionist Check, which can only be attempted by the target inside the net, or a DV13 Brawling Check which can be attempted by anyone. Succeeding at either of these destroys the net beyond repair. Replacement nets are 50eb (Costly) each.

The Matchmaker isn’t a great weapon since it is made entirely of common plumbing supplies. This gun is not designed for long battles, and ideally, is meant for only one quick kill so the user can acquire the gun of the former SovOil operative they just decommissioned.

The most significant benefit of the weapon is its ammunition-saving trigger feature which fires six bullets at once, allowing the shooter to worry less about how many bullets they can afford to dump into a target and more about how to end the fight quickly. The Pepper Shaker is an Exotic SMG that can only be fired using Autofire and cannot make Aimed Shots or fire in single shot mode. Despite being an Exotic Weapon, it can still load Non-Basic Ammunition. Unlike other weapons, when fired in Autofire, the Pepper Shaker uses 6 bullets instead of 10 per attack.

The downside to the Bubba Buster is, of course, the fact that it’s made by GunMart, and has serious durability issues. But as GunMart salespeople will try to tell you, the Bubba Buster only needs to shoot once or twice to be worth its price. Letting the gun cool for a minute after the first two shots is recommended to avoid overheating. The Bubba Buster is a Poor Quality Exotic Shotgun. Despite being an Exotic Weapon, it can still load Non-Basic Ammunition. If it fires three times in 1 minute (20 rounds in combat), the barrel will warp and the weapon will destroy itself.

The Overlord looks like a jacked-up revolver straight out of a classic cop film, but the cylinder is just a costume piece with no func- tionality. The large grip has a magazine tube and a clip that snaps each round into place. This slows down the firing rate dramatically. It doesn’t suffer from overheating like some other GunMart models, but the loading mechanism is as prone to jam as the ejection port. Who cares though? Just the look of the gun is enough to make someone think twice. The Overlord is a Poor Quality Exotic Heavy Pistol. Unlike other Heavy Pistols, it fires at 1 ROF. If used to threaten violence as part of a Facedown, the user adds +1 to the user’s Check unless the user recognizes the Overlord and knows it is a crap gun.

However, as is often the case with GunMart weapons, the brittle plastic “rails” and “hardpoints” are merely a cosmetic addition. Rockets are loaded into the rear of the weapon via a hatch in the back closed with a plastic cap. Stories of accidents caused by the Engage are common among Edgerunners but GunMart routinely pays Ziggurat to scrub them from the Data Pool. The Engage is a Poor Quality Exotic Rocket Launcher only capable of firing Armor Piercing Rockets. Each purchase comes with an Armor Piercing Rocket already loaded into its magazine. Whenever you roll a Critical Failure (a 1) while firing the weapon or you attempt to remove a loaded rocket from the Engage’s magazine, the ammunition inside detonates immediately, centered on the weapon.

The weapon’s laser targeting system allows the weapon to fire Smart Rockets without requiring Targeting Scope Cyberware.

The ammo box holds 40 shots that auto-feed into the shotgun. Pressure-release valves hiss with every shot, keeping the Beast just barely pointing in the right direction when fired. Due to its extreme weight, the stock slams into the shooter’s shoulder with each pull of the trigger, which is typically fine, provided they were strong enough to lift the weapon in the first place… otherwise, it’s going to send someone straight to the hospital. The Beast is an Exotic Shotgun with 40 rounds in its magazine. Despite being an Exotic Weapon, it can still load Non-Basic Ammunition. Firing this weapon without suffering the Broken Arm Critical Injury requires BODY 10 or higher unless it is mounted. Reloading this weapon requires using 2 Actions, and thus can only be done over the course of 2 Turns.

Not to mention the occasional need to shoot through an engine block. The weapon is an eleven-shot revolver with a forearm brace and ample venting ports. The vents, plus built-in proprietary compensators, allow for the weapon to be discharged without a cyberlimb to handle the recoil. What recoil Militech couldn’t reduce, they decided to make use of, recapturing the excess kinetic energy to prepare the gun to fire again, enabling the weapon to exceed its initial rate of fire when fired continuously. Only the initial alpha test production run was ever manufactured, as the weapon was deemed too expensive to produce by Militech. Due to the low quantity made and the general lack of desire owners have in parting with one, this hand cannon is extremely hard to find. This often drives the price for available units remarkably high. The Perseus is an Excellent Quality Exotic Very Heavy Pistol that holds 11 shots. If it was fired during the previous Round in a combat, it operates as a 2 ROF weapon instead of a 1 ROF weapon.

Militech designed the Fox to provide the user with options as well as sustained fire capacity. A selector switch near the handle allows the user to alternate between its twin helical magazines. This is an Exotic Heavy Pistol with two 10-round mag- azines. Each magazine can be loaded with a different ammunition type. Despite being an Exotic Weapon, it can still fire Non-Basic Ammunition. When firing the weapon, the user chooses which magazine to fire from. Each magazine must be reloaded independently using a separate Action.

Each Mastiff comes with an instruc- tion video showing how useful the shotgun feature is as some bastard decked out in far too much gear shoots hinges off doors and goes wild inside a room, dumping their whole clip. The top section of the mastiff is a submachine gun while the lower is a pump-action shotgun with a bottom feed chamber. The clip for the SMG fits between the trigger of the SMG and that of the shotgun. Because the Mastiff is primarily sold to police departments, thousands have leaked into Night Markets thanks to widespread corruption. This weapon is an Exotic Combination Two-Handed SMG and a Shotgun. The Shotgun has three shots in its magazine. Both modes of the weapon fire from separate magazines and each must be reloaded using a separate Action. It cannot be Concealed.

This pistol-turned-SMG-turned-assault rifle came in a lovely black carrying case with all the parts needed to convert it into the right weapon for those times when packing a whole gun cabinet just wasn’t practical. It was the perfect weapon for that Exec who wanted to look badass or the Solo who was too indecisive. Inside the included, sleek carrying case a new owner could find the ModFire10X core, a barrel extension, a foldable stock, and a set of proprietary magazines which partially replace the weapon’s firing mechanism when swapped out. The only complaint about the ModFire 10X was how design limitations made it incapable of autofire while in pistol mode. The autofire mode only becomes accessible when the barrel extension is locked into place along with either the SMG or Assault Rifle proprietary magazines. Centurion Essentials claimed that this was to keep the core from overheating and melting the barrel, but insiders claim it was so that customers would need to buy the whole package directly instead of just the parts they wanted on the secondary market. After the 4th Corporate War, the ModFire 10X seemed to fade from store shelves and wholesale distribution. Even still, today there are still some older Execs who keep one of these bad choombas under the seat. The ModFire 10X is an Exotic Heavy Pistol that can be transformed into an Exotic SMG or an Exotic Assault Rifle in 1 minute without a Check, assuming the user has access to the weapon’s modular parts. The parts all fit nicely in a tasteful foam-lined carrying case.

Made from the same material as seen in those popular metal dishware commercials, the Nomad Rocker looks like an ancient ship’s cannon fit for your hand, is scratch resistant, and is remarkably easy to clean. When fired, the airtight seal formed around the rock sweeps out any dust and debris left in its path, meaning that for maintenance, you only have to gently clean the exterior of the weapon. No disassembly needed! Drop it in a bucket of water, fire the gun, and you are ready to rock! The Nomad Rocker is a Poor Quality Exotic Very Heavy Pistol that fires rocks instead of bullets, making ammunition for the weapon free. Repairing a destroyed Nomad Rocker does not require a Check and takes 1 hour. E-TACK Public Defender Pursuit Security Inc. 500eb (Expensive) The E-TACK Public Defender was a short-lived new police standard during the 4th Corporate War. This pistol came with a built-in stun gun that gave officers the option of lethal or less-than-lethal force at just a thought but was discontinued due to the difficulty of mentally switching between the two modes in combat situations. This is Poor Quality Exotic Heavy Pistol lacks a trigger and comes permanently installed with the Smartgun Link weapon attachment. It is only capable of con- necting to a Subdermal Grip, which is required for it to operate. Whenever you fire this weapon, you can choose to use either its lethal setting or its less- than-lethal setting. Its lethal setting fires the shot as a regular Heavy Pistol would, taking its ammo from the standard 8-shot magazine. Its less-than-lethal setting does damage as a Heavy Pistol would, but if damage dealt by the shot would reduce a target to under 1 HP, they are instead Unconscious at 1 HP. Additionally, damage dealt by this weapon in its less-than-lethal setting cannot cause a Critical Injury and does not ablate armor. Using the less-than-lethal setting drains one shot from the weapon’s standard 50eb (Costly) eight-shot rechargeable (1 hour) battery pack instead of using ammunition from its mag- azine. If needed, a new battery can be switched in as an Action.

This assault rifle is equipped with a built-in shrieker, making it great for dispersing large, unruly mobs. The shrieker is located below the rifle barrel and is powered by a standard 50eb eight-shot rechargeable battery pack. Each Crowd Buster comes with a pair of Auto Level Dampening Ear Protectors to protect the user from the ear-damaging effects of firing the shrieker. There have been several lawsuits brought against Pursuit Security Incorporated by people claiming to have lost their hearing due to exposure, but due to the natural noise of city life those cases tend to get thrown out. This is an Exotic Assault Rifle with a unique alternative firing mode. As an Action the user can make a single shot using the Assault Rifle Range table, which, instead of dealing damage on a hit, forces the target to try to beat a DV15 Resist Torture/Drugs Check. If they fail, they suffer the Damaged Ear Critical Injury. Whenever this alternate firing mode is used, unless the user has some form of ear protection, they suffer the Damaged Ear Critical Injury. Included with every Crowd Buster is a pair of Auto Level Dampening Ear Protectors (see CP:R, page 351). While worn, the user is immune to deafness or other effects caused by dangerously loud noises, like those of a flash- bang. Using the alternative firing mode does not expend ammunition but instead drains one shot from the weapon’s standard 50eb (Costly) eight-shot rechargeable (1 hour) battery pack.

The Rostović Ulični Uništitelj originated in Neo-Soviet Russia, where it was commissioned by SovOil to help them deal with eco-terrorists hitting their installations. The idea of cramming scrap metal down the barrel came from a SovOil security officer looking to make a mess of a prisoner sentenced to death. The officer dumped old coins down the barrel and pulled the trigger, activating the magnetic rail system. The end result was the coins launching out first, shredding the prisoner before the pellets even left the gun. From then on, the practice seeped out into the general population, with gangs carrying bags of scrap metal to dump into their Ulični Uništitelj during firefights. The Rostović Ulični Uništitelj is a Poor Quality Exotic Shotgun with three shots. It is only capable of loading Shotgun Shells. As an Action, the wielder can shove a handful of metal objects into all three barrels. If the barrels are filled with metal objects, the weapon’s next fired Shotgun Shell deals 4d6 damage instead of 3d6 and clears all three barrels of metal objects.

The Hello Cutie Ultra-K8 assault pistol by Sanroo Firearms of Tokyo is a terrifying little machine pistol. This pistol was marketed toward cosplay gangs popping up across Tokyo and soon every anime-themed poser ganger from Tokyo to Night City had to get their hands on the Ultra-K8. The pistol comes with wild features, including a self-cooling barrel, audio playback of shooter’s voice with selectable anime filters, and an upper barrel track for added customization. It even giggles when you reload it! After a mass-shooting incident, the Japanese government ordered Sanroo to discontinue production of the gun. Unfortunately, well over 1,000 units had already been sold and shipped globally. Considered a collector’s item, the Ultra-K8 is well worth the price. This kawaii handcannon is an Excellent Quality Exotic Very Heavy Pistol, which can be reconfigured into an Excellent Quality Exotic Heavy SMG with an Action. In both modes, it fires from the same 30-round magazine of Very Heavy Pistol ammunition using the base damage of a weapon of its type. If the user is wearing at least 3 pieces of Asia Pop Fashion while wearing the weapon openly, it also gives the user a +2 to Wardrobe and Style Checks. This bonus only applies once and won’t combine with other weapons that grant a bonus to Wardrobe and Style.

To solve an issue with a previous ultralight prototype, Sternmeyer fit it with an integrated grenade launcher as a counterweight to balance the featherweight bullpup design. The result was a match made in gunsmith heaven, with the grenades loaded via a clip that slides underneath the launcher and the ammunition cartridge loaded into the stock. The M-04 really doesn’t need anything else. It’s bal- anced, weighs only 10 pounds, and wrecks just about anything it shoots at. It does have some issues with a “sticky” dual-function trigger, but more than makes up for it in utility. This is a Poor Quality Exotic Combination Assault Rifle and Grenade Launcher. Both modes of the weapon fire from separate magazines, the Assault Rifle magazine holding 20 bullets, and the Grenade Launcher magazine holding 2 grenades. Each magazine must be reloaded independently using a separate Action. When one mode of the weapon jams neither mode can be used until an Action is taken to reverse the malfunction. Despite being an Exotic Weapon, the Grenade Launcher portion of this weapon can still fire Non-Basic grenades.

The machine gun comes with an enormous under-locked ammo feed box. It is surprisingly easy to load despite its size, due to a unique “feed start” feature which automatically chambers the ammo belt using a magnetic arm once the box is locked into place. The BMG-500 can be held in two hands like a rifle, stabilized using the bipod under the barrel, or attached to a Vehicle Heavy Weapon Mount. Designed to pour through ammunition, the BMG-500 has a water-cooled hydrotronika™ barrel, and its design makes good use of exhaust ports to keep the weapon on target, even after spitting out five hundred rounds. The Techtronika BMG-500 is an Exotic Assault Rifle fired with the Heavy Weapons Skill when fired in single shot. Its enormous box magazine holds 500 rounds. Firing this weapon requires a BODY 11 or higher unless it is mounted. As an Action, its bipod can be deployed and rested on a surface. Doing so means the weapon is considered mounted until moved. Moving retracts the bipod automatically.

It is incredibly impractical but there is always some wanker who wants to look badass and thinks this “pistol” will do the job. The Tommyknocker is an oversized handgun paired with an underslung shotgun. The pistol is a standard CE design and reliable. It even includes a top rail for add-ons. Although adding more onto this gun just looks ridiculous, this doesn’t stop some users from throwing on some oversized scope. The shotgun has a super short pump done up in fancy black rubber with an under-clip built into the shotgun handle big enough for three shots. The pump is prone to stick, something CE denies and is quick to blame on user error. Additionally, unless the person firing the Tommyknocker has a muscular grip on the gun with both hands, the weapon is likely to fly out of the user’s hand when the weapon is fired. This is an Exotic Combination Very Heavy Pistol and Poor Quality Shotgun. The pistol has 8 shots in its magazine while the shotgun has only 2 shots in its magazine. Both modes of the weapon fire from separate magazines. Unless you have a BODY 10 or higher or are holding the weapon in two hands, the Tommyknocker flies out of your hand 6m/yds away from you in a direction of the GM’s choosing after it is fired. The weapon has one attachment slot which can only be used to attach a scope compatible with both a Very Heavy Pistol and a Shotgun.

This is Jericho Hunt with Today at the Source! You might usually hear a corporate program at this time on this wavelength, but we’ve temporarily improved your regularly scheduled morning junk show thanks to advancements in signal hijacking. Ever wonder about the big picture? Now you’re gonna get it. The truth about our supply chain. The one right outside your window. Night City, it is time to wake up! Hey, let’s throw some play examples in here. This is the type of story you can tell with the Economy in the Time of The Red. They’ll be in italics, choomba. How It Is Now You heard the rumors. You saw the advertisements. Now all that’s running through your grey matter is “how do I get that trendy new thing?”. It used to be simple. Twenty years back, the whole world didn’t know how good they had it. Their only barrier was cash on hand. If you had some you could afford all your wants and needs. That was before the Fourth Corporate War and the DataKrash. For us, things aren’t so easy. You don’t just need the cash or something to trade with. You need to know somebody with access to the thing you want. Love them or hate them, that’s your friendly local Fixer. How what you need gets to them, that’s a bit more complicated. Fortunately, you’re listening to the right Media to explain it all. James is GMing a game of Cyberpunk RED for a pair of newlyweds, Tennessee, playing “Rat” the Nomad, and Sonny, playing “Ariadne” the Media. Sonny wants to buy a ModFire 10X, and has the req- uisite 1,000eb on hand, but can’t find one because Ariadne only has access to items 100eb or less as a non-Fixer. They pass a DV17 Streetwise Check and the GM gives them info on a reputable Fixer named Tanjiro. They set up a meeting. tHe supply CHaIN While the Megacorps pretend we’re back in the good old days, advertising to create demand, lying through their sharp teeth, saying you can just head down to the mall to grab what they’re selling, Fixers act like they are damn magicians. Speak thy product’s name and it shalt appear. They are both full of shit. A lot of elbow grease goes into getting your precious product into your hands these days. In a decrepit indoor batting cage in Santo Domingo, Tanjiro stages a meeting with Ariadne and Rat, and starts working them over with his Fixer Role Ability, Operator. Tanjiro’s COOL + Trading + Operator Rank + 1d10 comes out much higher than Ariadne’s COOL + Trading + 1d10, even with a successful Complementary Skill Check by Rat, so the Fixer uses Haggle (see CP:R page 159) to charge 10% more for the item, bringing up the cost to 1,100eb. But Tanjiro isn’t done and adds in his own cut. In this case, a 100eb “processing fee” on top. When Rat challenges him on it, Tanjiro puts his hand into his jacket pocket, pre- sumably onto the handle of some concealed weapon, and stares Rat down, mad-dogging him. “Take it or don’t leave at all”. It’s a Facedown, COOL + Reputation + 1d10 vs. COOL + Reputation + 1d10 and Tanjiro wins again. Rat chooses to Back Down instead of risking a fight over 100eb and spots Ariadne the 200eb they were missing to buy the ModFire 10X. This is a strictly cash upfront business. Tanjiro quickly changes his tune while counting their money and tells them he’ll call in roughly a month when he has their new toy. ▶ How Your Fixer Finds It ◀ You’ve asked your Fixer nicely in the correct denomina- tions and they’ve given you their word, so they grab their Agent and get to work, reaching out to their network. Who do they know? Of course, you’ve got Netrunners eager to sell stolen cargo ship manifest data and other Edgerunners they can call on for favors but that’s only a fraction of their contacts. It may surprise you, but most of a Fixer’s contacts aren’t that illicit. They’re normal people, beavers, at the bottom of the Megacorporate totem pole without Exec- level jobs, like warehouse analysts, quality assurance team associates, and shift lead supervisors, all of whom happen to be open to taking bribes. In this economy, who wouldn’t take a bribe? You can’t really blame them. The Megacorporate cradle-to-grave employment model of the 2020s did not take the DataKrash well. It didn’t die, but it did get cancer. Unfortunately, I don’t think it’s terminal. A lot of its tumors kept those jobs-for- life but started a quiet night hustle stealing paper clips and information from the office for your local Fixer. And that’s power if you’ve been paying attention. Let me spell it out. Here, Rat and Ariadne use Streetwise to find a Fixer but checking in with one they already know, either from their Lifepath or previously completed missions, is a perfectly valid strategy. In such cases, the GM can decide if a Fixer they already know can get the item or even has time to do so. 127 ECONOMICS 101 Later that night, Tanjiro opens his Agent and calls around the city. His Operator Rank of 7 lets him source items up to Very Expensive, even if they are otherwise unavailable. He knows a choom who knows a choom, so he gets a good night’s sleep in order to rest up for an early morning meeting with them tomorrow. ▶ How Your Fixer Acquires It ◀ With the location of the thing you want, your local Fixer moves to get it. Sometimes they’ve got a bill of sale, and there’s another owner or a Fixer on the other end, so it’s a negotiation. Sometimes it’s sitting in a corpo- rate warehouse, so they bribe a worker or hire a team to retrieve it. Sometimes, it’s supposedly in a Cargo Container last seen in the Pacific a year ago, and I get called to track down which Thelas Nomad ship’s cargo hold it is sitting in. If all this sounds expensive to you, that’s because it is. Expect to pay in full. Dressed for blood rain in the thick morning fog, Tanjiro meets with his Thelas contact at the end of a pier in South Night City. They’ve got a crate of six ModFire 10Xs recently recovered from a container ship that wrecked just off the coast of Portland. Tanjiro inspects the crate for tracking devices with the Conceal/Reveal Object Skill, then buys the entire crate of 6 for the cost of 5 using another successful Haggle. If you’re keeping track, once Tanjiro sells those guns, he’ll be making at least 1,200eb profit for what’s essentially a day’s work. That’s 200eb from Ariadne and Rat plus 1,000eb for the 6th ModFire 10X. And that’s assuming he doesn’t get another 10% on each additional gun sold. If that happens, Tanjiro will walk away from this one deal with 1,700eb extra in his pocket. ▶ How Your Fixer Gets It To You ◀ Assuming the product isn’t already in Night City, either in someone’s warehouse or coming out of one of the increasingly busy local factories, what happens next? Short answer, your Fixer calls a Nomad. Better answer: they book cargo space on a Nomad transport bound for you. They’re likely calling the Aldecaldos if it’s coming from the north or the east or from Mexico or the Jodes if it’s coming from South America. If it’s coming over the Pacific, that’s the Thelas, but it might occasion- ally be the Meta. If they aren’t dealing with one of the big Nomad Families, that means they’re calling Snake Nation-unaffiliated Nomads. Hey, stay with me. We’re about to get to the point. On his ride back home, having just learned of the sunken container ship off the coast of Portland, Tanjiro immediately calls a contact with the Aldecaldos and buys up all the cargo space he can afford on one of their transports from Portland to Night City one month from now. ▶ Why Your Fixer Does It ◀ You paid upfront. The Fixer got you what you needed. You’re a happy customer. In the process, the Fixer got new contacts by putting your cash in their hands, growing their network. They earned trust, grew their reputation, and got paid doing it. See the big picture? It’s a virtuous cycle. For them. They wouldn’t have it any other way. Oh, and your thing wasn’t the only thing they put on that Nomad Transport, but it sure did help finance the trip. Your local Fixer is cooking up some- thing big, maybe if you do them a favor, they’ll invite you to their Night Market later. For now, let’s focus on that thing you wanted. Who made it anyway? Tanjiro calls up Ariadne and says that there’s been a change of plans. He’s got the ModFire 10X they wanted, ahead of schedule. But there’s more. He’s got a job for Ariadne and their Nomad friend, Rat. Easy money. “Ever been to Portland?” he asks. wHo Made your tHINg Unless it’s prewar gear sourced from a wayward cargo container, a rare item brought from afar by Nomads, or something new from a local factory, it’s likely an unknown Tech made your thing. Do you really know the name MatchSchtik from who-knows-where your local Fixer sourced from? You don’t need to know. If you did, they would likely have a publicist. It looks like solid work though. Not just anyone can make one of these after all. Consider that by the transitive property of this shit, MatchSchtik’s reputation is your local Fixer’s reputation. So, their name should mean quality to you, and if it doesn’t, you should find a new Fixer, who, now that I think about it, is basically their publicist. When they get back from Portland, Rat wants a ModFire 10X of his own, after seeing one in action. But considering what just happened, both Rat and Ariadne want nothing to do with Fixers for the moment. MatchSchtik is a Tech who Ariadne and Rat are tight with, so they decide to call them up to see about print- ing a ModFire 10X from scratch. In theory, any Fixer can acquire any item but many specialize and prefer to stay within their area of expertise. Matching the Fixer to the item presents a chance for world-building on the GM’s part. Remember, Fixers aren’t stores. They’re people with personalities and represent a roleplaying opportunity. 128 ECONOMICS 101 ▶ Who Else Do Do Techs Work For? ◀ Typically, no Tech can survive on only a single client, unless they’ve got a Corporate job, and even then, most of them will moonlight. Their clientele isn’t just Fixers. They work for Execs too, building from scrap and scratch what can’t be found in the wreckage the DataKrash turned the shipping networks into, filling the gaping holes it left in the economy. They’ll work for you too. It’s better to buy directly because it earns you the relationship instead of letting the Fixer have it. Just be prepared to get your hands dirty in a way you wouldn’t have to with a Fixer. MatchSchtik is game to Fabricate a ModFire 10X using the Tech Role Ability Maker for Rat, but it’s gonna take them two weeks. There’s also a catch. Rat and Ariadne will have to find a way to get him the 500eb (Expensive) worth of materials he needs and they’ll owe him a favor. Oh, and the build could also fail, which would make things take longer than two weeks. No promises. But I waNt tHe oNe IN tHe advertIseMeNt You got a Trauma Team Executive card? No? Free advice. Don’t look at Corporate advertisements. They aren’t for you. They aren’t for us. You don’t want to meet anyone they do target. If you do, plant the barrel of your gun between their eyes and pull twice, once to get through the subdermal, once for effect, and run as fast as you can. Half the time, you’ve done someone else a favor or saved yourself the same fate. Don’t deal in brand names unless you have to. Scratch the logo out or don’t come up to my table looking like a victim. At least cover it up. Flexing their Media Role Ability (see CP:R page 151), Ariadne finds a rumor about a material shipment that should be relatively undefended as it crosses through the badlands to the south of Night City. Without messing with a Fixer again, it’s the only shot the crew sees to get what they need. GMs, take note. Why make something a boring shopping trip when it could be an adventure? wHat aBout tHe MegaCorps? The Elephant in every room. It’s the nature of our system to concentrate wealth in the hands of the few, especially in times of crisis. And, guess what, the Corps specialize in concentration even in the Time of the Red. It’s not like they stopped making consumer goods, supply just went down the drain. Instead of making hundreds of thousands of units, now they’re making hundreds or thousands of units. That’s just enough to keep their operations running and their fat cats nice and fed. As a Nomad, Rat knows the badlands like the back of his hand and easily succeeds at a Local Expert Check to find an ambush point. The crew gets in position. ▶ And Those Units Sell. Fast! ◀ Let’s say you’ve heard all about the Rocklin Augmentics newtech being released and you really want it. So, you head on down to Rocklin Aug HQ on release day only to find your precious newtech’s all sold out, even though you showed up an hour early. Guess who knew the exact release time, bribed a Corp beaver to get to the top of the sell list, and backed their truck up to the loading dock last night? If it wasn’t your friendly local Fixer, it was one of seven other Fixers that all competed for their slice. There just wasn’t enough to go around after all. Next time, skip the line to victimize yourself and get a Tech to make you one. Don’t feed the Elephant, feed a Tech. Let’s make our own consumer culture! Be a real fucking punk! But the glitterkids streaming on the Garden Patch have one, you whine? Guess who was first in line to buy from the Fixers who got a slice? Here’s a hint: I just told you to brain them. Transforming their ModFire 10X into Assault Rifle mode, Ariadne hides among the chaparral atop a ridge, while a masked Rat waits on his custom roadbike, smoke grenade in hand. How dId It get tHIs Bad aNyway? The DataKrash shut the Old NET down, and that shut us down. In the 2020s, we were expanding too fast and doing a great job killing each other off in the Fourth Corporate War, mining trade routes with self-replicating mines, sinking ships and wrecking rail lines and blowing up factories. We didn’t think about side effects. Drive twenty minutes outside of the city limits and look around. Have you ever seen a historical picture of California? Compare it to the real thing and think about what we did to it. If we cared this little about the environment, do you think we cared about NET security? Even if Bartmoss 129 ECONOMICS 101 hadn’t blown up the Old NET, it would have happened eventually. We were driving too fast. The flaw was a cultural one, and we haven’t fixed it since. We’ll recover from this, and we won’t learn. The beast will live. A lone, unmarked truck approaches matching the description. Ariadne takes the shot, aiming for the vehicle’s tires. Armored. No dice. Their next shot is for the driver, smashing glass into the cockpit, but missing the mark. Rat accelerates on a collision course with the truck, tossing his smoke grenade into the cockpit. Blinded, the driver loses control of the vehicle, crashing into a red rock wall. Rat fires his shotgun blindly into the cloud, retreating at roadbike speed. On foot, a bleed- ing man in Militech fatigues exits the smoke, weapon drawn. Dumping Luck, Ariadne aims, emptying the driver’s wet head cavity onto the dusty badland road. wHy dIdN’t we all dIe? Many did. Old people, without much contact with the outside world, couldn’t get medications. That’s on all of us. Power went out. People froze. People got heat stroke. Widespread starvation. Diseases. Fucking nuke in the center of Night City. That’s on all of us. Just because you can’t prosecute doesn’t mean a crime didn’t take place. I do know who saved us, though. Nomads. We were cut off, starving, eating ourselves alive. That’s about when the first Nomad supply trains arrived, reconnecting us with food from Canada’s breadbasket. Bellies full, or at least not eating themselves, we started being human again. The murder rate tanked. What if the Nomads never came? Think about that shit. The Megacorporations didn’t save us. They saved themselves, nearly killing themselves in the process. We saved us. Don’t forget it. Buy a Nomad a drink sometime. When the smoke clears, Rat approaches the crashed vehicle, shotgun drawn. His Perception Skill Check can’t find anyone in hiding, so he pops open the trunk, finding the resources MatchSchtik was asking for and a gagged hostage, badly wounded from the crash. Rat tries an emergency First Aid Skill Check, but fumbles. As the gagged hostage fails their Death Save, Rat watches the light drift from their eyes and takes 1d6 Humanity Loss from the resulting Mental Trauma. How dId tHe NoMads do It? In the 2020s, the supply chain was as big of a beast as the beast of an economy it fed. Nomads were there, just under the surface, on every merchant vessel, and behind the wheel of most every truck. Who did you think had the skills to do those jobs anyway? The supply chain was reaching toward being entirely AI-driven but hadn’t quite reached it yet. Logistics depended entirely on algorithms that were themselves built by algorithms, managed by a thin veneer of human interaction. Already weakened by war, when the DataKrash hit, each link on the chain feeding the beast didn’t under- stand where its next link was. Every link shattered, independently. The humans, many of them Nomads, who had been painted thin atop the chain were left in the possession of thoughtless robots and the inventories of their vessels. For the first time in ever, they were in control of the — you ever hear the term means of production? Same thing goes for means of transport, too. As the world broke around them, those humans were left with the keys to the kingdom, basically. Some couldn’t handle the pressure, became road gangers, and stood in the way of progress. Others rose up, joined together with their Families, and did their job without the assistance of the robots. Only, when they arrived at their destination, they didn’t work for the Corps anymore. They worked for themselves. With the materials in hand, MatchSchtik is able to Fabricate a ModFire 10X for Rat. A couple of months in the future, maybe he’ll call in the favor owed. But that’s a worry for tomorrow. Tonight, Rat and Ariadne are deciding where to go for a celebratory drink. Heads, it’s the Afterlife. Tails, it’s Metalstorm. Looks like the Corp-run signal is muscling back onto this frequency so that’s all we have time for today. Night City, this has been Jericho Hunt and this has been Today at the Source. ▶FINd a FIxer/teCH to get/BuIld aN IteM Item Cost Streetwise DV 500eb (Expensive) DV15 1,000eb (V Expensive) DV17 5,000eb (Luxury) DV21 10,000eb+ (Super Luxury) DV24 The DVs presented here are guidelines.

It’s just upstairs in Short Circuit, Night City’s premiere Tech and Netrunner bar. The aroma of home-cooked meals seep under the door as faint sounds of 1970s glam rock permeate the air inside a storage space filled with knick knacks. The family has salvaged and repurposed the trove of gear and hardware here with a ton of TLC. As a result, much of it is better now than when it was new. A second-hand tech store of resoldered treasures! FrequeNCy 3-Piece only opens the Joint monthly and on a random schedule. Some folks speculate it’s whenever he has enough stock but those in the know understand that scarcity creates a sense of rarity and demand that translates into cold hard digital cash! 3-Piece is many things — a father, a Fixer, and a Media star of his own Garden Patch dedicated to financial topics. Above all, he knows how to make a dollar, keep the roof over his family’s head, and put food on their table. All with a touch of swagger. wHo ruNs It? 3-Piece is a strikingly handsome Fixer with a talent for tech-related business. He’s always dressed to the nines and in an armor-lined suit. He’s proud of what he’s created with his family and that’s always first. 3-Piece is determined not to lose this home, his Joint, or Short Circuit, which he owns with Brain (his husband) and Bug (their daughter). wHat does It sell? The Joint specializes in tech, be it tech parts, cyber- decks, cyberdeck hardware, or programs. While the selection varies from month to month, it compensates for the lack of regularity with an abundance of quality. Nothing in 3-Piece’s Joint is ever sold incomplete or broken unless the customer wants it that way. 3-Piece has spent years mastering the hustle by trading lower-quality items for favors, information, and services, enabling the locating of higher-end products. wHere Is It Held? 3-Piece’s Joint is on the top floor of the new Short Circuit in Little Europe on the edge of the Hot Zone. They founded the bar five years ago and named it in honor of the original, which bit the dust when the nuke went off. The three-story building has been reinforced and has an elevator, big enough for a squad of Solos, running the height of the exterior wall. The first floor is always filled with Techs making marvels on workbenches while Brain and the staff serve the occasional drink and pick up all the gossip. Netrunners call the second-floor home, taking advan- tage of comfortable chairs and a set of custom NET Architectures designed to act as virtual clubs. The third floor is private and contains the family’s apartment, Brain’s workshop, 3-Piece’s recording studio, and the storage space 3-Piece uses as a Night Market. How do you sCore aN INvIte? They don’t let just anyone in. A potential customer must have been a patron of Short Circuit for a while. Once he or his husband gets to know you, or someone they trust vouches for you, 3-Piece invites you in. Or so they say. In truth, it all comes down to Bug. Bug has a knack for spotting narcs, undercover Corps, and turncoats. Maybe it’s because they ignore the kid? Maybe the kid’s learned from her fathers. Either way, Bug knows. gettINg IN oN tHe aCtIoN 3-Piece does not allow other Fixers to set up shop in his Joint, but he might take pieces on commission if Brain or Bug ask him to. seCurIty Short Circuit has numerous Zhirafa drones, operated by Netrunners on the bar’s payroll, patrolling and provid- ing security. The drones handle most problems simply by their presence alone. There’s additional security on the third floor. In addition to several Demon-watched observation cameras, security locks can be found on all doors, biometrically locked to 3-Piece, Brain, and Bug. Inside 3-Piece’s Joint unlucky intruders find strategi- cally placed stun panels, and the elevator up is rigged with sleeping gas in case someone manages to make it past the drones. AA 3-Piece was first introduced in Salvaging Night City, a free DLC available on our website. His husband, Brain, was first introduced in Edgerunners Inc, a sourcebook for Cyberpunk 2020. 133 NIGHT MARKETS rolesSeriously wounded Death save HP INt 7 5 6 6 8 6 4 4 5 STATS weapons armor skill bases 18 4 35 excellent Quality heavy pistol ROF2 3d6 light melee weapon ROF2 1d6 t&c executive armor (body) SP 11 — — Accounting 10•Acting 10•Athletics 8•Basic Tech 10•Brawling 8•Bribery 12•Bureaucracy 10•Business 12•Composition 10 Concentration 8•Conversation 10•Education 10•Electronics/Security Tech 8•Evasion 8•First Aid 8•Handgun 7 Human Perception 10•Language (English) 12•Language (Portuguese) 12•Language (Spanish) 12•Language (Streetslang) 12 Language (Swahili) 12•Library Search 10•Lip Reading 10•Local Expert (Little Europe) 10•Melee Weapon 10• Personal Grooming 12 Perception 10• Persuasion 12•Photography/Film 10•Stealth 8•Streetwise 12•Trading 14•Wardrobe & Style 12 GEAR Basic Heavy Pistol Ammo x20•Agent•Computer•Disposable Cellphone x2•Skill Chip (Language of GM’s choice, not slotted) x2 Techtool•Tech Upgraded Vial of Biotoxin (DV17 Resist Torture/Drugs)•Video Camera cyberware AudioVox•Biomonitor•Neuralware w/ Chipware Socket•Techhair fixer: OperatOr 5 media: Credibility 2 REP 5 reF dex teCH Cool wIll Move Body eMp 3-PIECE 2 3 4 AA 1: Cyberfingers 2: Weapons 3: Electronics and Tech 4: Fashion 5: Cyberware 1 5 136 NIGHT MARKETS W oodchipper’s Block Party w o o dc h ip p e r s b l o c kp a rt y w o o dc h ip p e r Nomads play a key role in transporting goods between cities in the Time of the Red but, on occasion, they trade their vehicles in for a cash register to sell their wares. Woodchipper’s Block Party is the largest Nomad-run market in Night City, transforming dull trade into a celebration of community. FrequeNCy Woodchipper throws a Night Market approximately every other month, but timing ultimately depends on the movements of the Jodes, Thelas, and especially the Aldecaldo Nomad Nations. Since it’s always held outside, weather is also a factor. Blood rain can really put a damper on a block party. wHo ruNs It? Woodchipper, the Aldecaldo Family’s inter-Nomad mediator and Night City’s premier Nomad-affiliated gunrunning Fixer. Just over seven feet tall after her latest internal linear frame installation, she often jokes it’s easy to mediate peace from her vantage point. Plus, subdermal armor helps deflect the sort of harsh words and small caliber rounds used when negotiations get heated. Within the Nomad ranks, she wears many addi- tional hats, serving as a marriage counselor, extra- legal judge, and occasional private investigator. Outside of the bounds of the Aldecaldos territory, she functions as the ultimate intermediary between Night City Fixers and guns running out of South America and Texas via the Jodes, from across the Pacific Ocean via the Thelas Family, and via north- ern California and almost everywhere thanks to the Aldecaldos. wHat does It sell? Woodchipper built the market on selling guns to every- one invited, and wheels to individually vetted Fixers who are invited to sponsor the Night Market. That’s right, guns and bikes, everything a Nomad needs! Plus, outdoor living essentials and ammunition! Her market is also widely considered a safe place to get tuned — to get your first Internal Linear Frame surgery. But there’s a final, far more important reason to come to Woodchipper’s market: the food. Specifically, we’re talking about auténtico street corn. If the only corn you’ve ever had has been in syrup form, or been shat out by Continental Brands, you owe it to yourself. wHere Is It Held? The market sets up shop on a particular cul-de-sac in Santo Domingo, near Woodchipper’s garage. On market day, the street is festooned with pennants and colorful lights. Stalls and tables dragged out along the curb to make up the storefronts of the market. The sounds of live music and festival atmosphere are audible for about a mile out from the site. Since the bomb went off, not a single noise complaint has been seriously enforced in Santo Domingo. Almost nobody even files them anymore. How do you sCore aN INvIte? Being a Nomad in good standing in the Aldecaldo, Jode, or Thelas Nations is enough to score you and up to four guests an invite to street corn heaven. Otherwise, you’ll have to get your hands dirty by earning your invite, likely by helping one of those three groups. gettINg IN oN tHe aCtIoN There’s a third option for attending, and that’s being a sponsor of one of Woodchipper’s markets, an opportunity available to Fixers of Operator Rank 5 or higher. That’ll get you a booth, entrance for you and your friends, and face time with the woman in charge. seCurIty Woodchipper’s Night Market is not just her own but also an extension of the Aldecaldos’ influence in the region. Thus, they send their best fighters to protect it. They call themselves Lobos, but most people with brains in Night City call them “not someone you want to fuck with.” Just a few interspersed among the crowd is enough to deter inter-Nomad infighting. The Lobos on the roofs, behind the windows, and patrolling the neighboring streets beyond the block party in custom bikes are there to deter assault. The Lobos escorting Woodchipper during the event, on the other hand, are there entirely to project power. After all, you don’t need to defend a walking tank from assassination. BB Woodchipper was first introduced in the Welcome to Night City chapter of the Cyberpunk RED core rulebook. Nomads are broken up into different Nations, each comprised of many families and packs. The Aldecaldos and Jodes are land based. The Thelas are water based. 137 NIGHT MARKETS Seriously wounded Death save HP INt 5 4 8 6 7 8 5 15 6 STATS weapons armor skill bases 35 15 70 martial arts attack ROF2 4d6 None — — tech upg subdermal armor (head) SP 12 SP 12 Air Vehicle Tech 10•Athletics 12•Brawling 16•Bribery 12•Concentration 10•Conversation 11•Deduction 10 Drive Land Vehicle 11•Endurance 12•Education 10•Evasion 14•First Aid 10•Handgun 10•Heavy Weapons 10 Human Perception 13•Land Vehicle Tech 10•Language (English) 11•Language (Japanese) 9•Language (Mandarin) 9 Language (Spanish) 11•Language (Streetslang) 10•Local Expert (Badlands) 12•Local Expert (Santo Domingo) 12 Martial Arts (Akido) 16•Perception 11•Persuasion 13•Pilot Air Vehicle 10•Pilot Sea Vehicle 10•Resist Torture/Drugs 12 Sea Vehicle Tech 10•Stealth 10•Streetwise 11•Tracking 10•Trading 12•Wilderness Survival 10 GEAR Basic Heavy Pistol Ammo x16•Agent•Anti-Smog Breathing Mask•Disposable Cellphone Compact Groundcar w/ Heavy Chassis and Housing Capacity•Diego Motors Range Trike•Urban Flash Footwear cyberware Contraceptive Implant•Grafted Muscle and Bone Lace x2•Neural Link w/ Reflex Co-Processor Tech Upgraded Implanted Linear Frame Beta (BODY 15) w/ Borgware Hardened Shielding•Tech Upgraded Subdermal Armor (SP 12) reF dex teCH Cool wIll Move Body eMp WOODCHIPPERrolesfixer: OperatOr 5 nomad: MOtO 4 (bOnuses inCluded in skill bases) REP 7 tech upg subdermal armor (body) *Tech UpG = This item has been upgraded in some way using a Tech’s Maker ability. 1 2 3 5 6 BB 1: Vehicles 2: Survival Gear 3: Weapons 4: Fashion 5: Linear Frames 6: Cyberware 7: More Weapons 4 7 140 NIGHT MARKETS M olly Anderson’s Market m o ll ya n d e r s o n s mar k e t A true child of the Time of the Red, Molly Anderson has grown from the scrappy older sibling of a ragtag group of Combat Zone orphans into a potent mid- level Fixer whose influence is growing every day. Their underground Night Market represents the ultimate in recycling as their gang, the Andersons, recycles the dead into enough eb to live on. FrequeNCy Molly’s Market is open for business monthly, but the timing depends on how relatively safe the Old Combat Zone has been lately. Paradoxically, the worse things are, the better Molly does. More death means more salvage because dead people’s parts and belongings make up the majority of what you’ll find for sale. wHo ruNs It? Molly Anderson, leader of the Anderson Family Gang, recently took over the collection, ripping, and transport of much of the “salvage” that comes out of the Old Combat Zone, the lawless meat grinder that raised her. Just south of Old Japantown, Molly has taken their gang to the big time despite a falling out with their former Fixer mentor back in One Block. Despite the change of scenery, Molly’s still the same person they’ve always been: cheerful, yet guarded, and violently pro- tective of their found family. So be warned: get caught inbetween an Anderson and anything they want, and there’s a good chance you’ll transition from a potential customer to a product. wHat does It sell? Molly’s Market sells a little bit of everything, but most of the goods used to belong to someone else, espe- cially the cyberware. “Who wouldn’t want to take a walk in somebody else’s shoes, but also with their feet too,” jokes Maurice Anderson, the Family’s own ripperdoc-in-training. If you aren’t in the market for a gently lived-in and refurbished cyberlimb, there’s plenty of second-hand guns and armor, all of which Judie Anderson has taken to repainting and otherwise touching up for added customer interest. Minne and Joe, two of the newest Andersons, help Judie organize the scrap when they aren’t out salvaging and work hard to earn the favor of their new kin. wHere Is It Held? Originally, Molly’s Night Markets were held wherever they could find a secluded defensible area in the Old Combat Zone, but there were some initial security hiccups. Out of an abundance of caution, Molly paid some reliable contractors to harden an underground parking structure buried beneath a toppled high-rise in the Old Combat Zone. In the eyes of the limited public they’ve invited in, it’s transformed from a ruined concrete cavern into a suicidal spider hole with one way in and out. There’s little chance of assault without heavy casualties on both sides, custom- ers included. The Andersons seem willing to defend it with their lives, and that concept has functioned as deterrence. How do you sCore aN INvIte? You’ll have to earn one. All potential invitations go through Molly Anderson’s hands at some point, so it’s them you’ll have to convince. If you can get an Anderson to vouch for you, an invite is a near guarantee. Having a reputation in the Old Combat Zone or Old Japantown improves your chances. If you look like trouble, expect to be asked to prove your trustworthiness before being granted an invite. The Andersons can always use extra guards when they go salvaging so it’s common to volunteer a shift in return for an invite. Do well, and they’re likely to keep you in the loop about future Night Markets, too. gettINg IN oN tHe aCtIoN Molly does allow other Fixers to sell at their Market but only those with a lower Operator Rank than them and only if they’ve built a bond of trust. Even then, they’ll insist all Fixers follow the rules when it comes to security. Only Andersons carry weapons in Molly’s Market. seCurIty The twins, Marco and Andy Anderson, function as the heads of security for Molly’s Market. They always keep a turret trained on the entrance and pat down anyone entering the market. Guests aren’t allowed to carry weapons in the facility and, if you yourself look like a weapon, Joe or Minnie Anderson, typically armed with Microwavers and similar anti-cybertech gear, will follow you while you shop, to encourage you not to try anything stupid. If you are assigned an Anderson as an involuntary armed escort, be sure to tip them before you leave, or you can forget about getting invited back. CC Molly Anderson and their gang were first introduced in the Cyberpunk RED Jumpstart Kit. 141 NIGHT MARKETS Seriously wounded Death save HP INt 7 5 8 5 6 7 6 4 4 STATS weapons armor skill bases 20 4 40 shuriken tornado grenade ROF1 6d6 brawling attack ROF2 2d6 SP 12 — Athletics 14•Basic Tech 12•Brawling 14•Concentration 9•Contortionist 14•Conversation 6•Dance 12•Demolitions 10 Endurance 13•Education 9•Electronics/Security Tech 10•Evasion 14•First Aid 11•Human Perception 8 Language (English) 11•Language (German) 11•Language (Japanese) 11•Language (Spanish) 11•Language (Streetslang) 13 Lip Reading 13•Local Expert (Old Combat Zone) 15•Perception 9•Persuasion 10•Pick Lock 11•Resist Torture/Drugs 13 Stealth 13•Streetwise 14•Trading 13•Wardrobe & Style 13 GEAR Arachnid Grenade•Shuriken Tornado Grenade x3•Smoke Grenade x2•TR-4 Detonator Fluid•Gang Colors Disposable Cellphone•Glow Paint x2•Lock Picking Set•Scrambler/Descrambler Tech Upgraded Piranha-Supplied Smash (Secondary Effect DV9) cyberware Contraceptive Implant•Cyberarm w/ Extra-Jointed Cyberlimb Upgrade and Realskinn™ Covering Cyberleg x2 w/ Hardened Shielding x2 and Realskinn™ Covering x2•Light Tattoo x2•Neural Link w/ Reflex Co-Processor reF dex teCH Cool wIll Move Body eMp MOLLY ANDERSON fixer: OperatOr 6 5roleREP tech upg laser light st Jacket (body) — *Tech UpG = This item has been upgraded in some way using a Tech’s Maker ability. 2 3 CC 1 4 5 6 1: Music 2: Security Gear 3: Cyberware 4: Weapons 5: Vehicles 6: Other Junk 144 NIGHT MARKETS M ister K’s Midnight Market m i s t e r k s m i d n i ght mar k e t Mister Kernaghan’s Midnight Market is an exclusive event run according to the whims of its elusive host. Night City’s premiere Fixer knows anyone who’s worth knowing in Night City, and periodically summons them to bid on unique items and to enjoy the best stores and services in the city for one night only. FrequeNCy This Market runs quarterly, but there are no fixed dates. Instead, Mister Kernaghan judges when he has items of sufficient interest based on personal criteria. The event is prestigious enough to merit canceling any other plans, and the luxury vendors who fill out the sales floors are always eager to drop what they’re doing when he calls. wHo ruNs It? Mister Kernaghan, though he rarely puts in a personal appearance until the auction at the climax of each event. He’s a tall, stocky man in his sixties and is never seen without his enormous cat, Kosmos. His fortunes came from exploiting a cache of shipping data he liberated in the 4th Corporate War. He reached his current position of power by making his own luck and staying ahead of every market need. wHat does It sell? This Midnight Market sells goods of intererst to high-end customers as well as an eclectic collection of Super Luxury items worth at least 10,000eb. High-end vehicles, long-lost artworks, and unique prototype technologies are a sample of Mister Kernighan’s finds. All other commercial dealings are in the hands of the luxury merchants who rent the rest of the space for pop-ups designed to feel less like carnival fare and more like a luxury experience. Say the Exec family books little Francesca, and a dozen of her carefully vetted friends, a birthday party at the family-friendly Mona’s. Little Princes supplies an indispensable nanny at a discounted rate, freeing the parents from refereeing 10-year-olds hyped on Bon- Bon’s sample trays. Forever Friends gives the birthday girl a free trial of an eternally cute puppy that knows just how to melt her heart well within the 48 hours before the intro subscription needs to be re-upped. Meanwhile, Francesca’s parents can forget they even have children and spend their ebs by relaxing at The Birdcage. wHere Is It Held? No secret, this. Above the Atlantis, in The Glen, across two floors filled with luxury goods and services and cutting-edge decor. In contrast to the edgy disorien- tating atmosphere of the nightclub downstairs, patrons emerge from the elevator into a space offering class and sophistication. With several hundred attendees plus vendors and staff it never feels overly crowded and the mix of boutiques, eateries, and services keeps the crowd circulating to make the most of what is, for many, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. How do you sCore aN INvIte? No ostentatious bribe will get you past the polite, uni- formed guards on the door. One hundred invitations are delivered by courier and personally handed to the lucky souls deemed worthy, interesting, or wealthy enough to participate. Invitations can confirm a high-roller’s status or boost the profile of an up-and-coming Exec. Once delivered, the invitation can be sold, gifted, or even stolen if somebody wants one badly enough. Every bearer can bring guests, be they bodyguards, co-work- ers, or family. Entourage sizes vary but the door guards have final say as to what is deemed reasonable. gettINg IN oN tHe aCtIoN Mister Kernighan only works with other Fixers if they have something unique to offer at the auction, something few do unless their Operator Rank is 8 or higher. He hand-selects some of Night City’s most prestigious vendors, caterers, and service providers and rents them space during the Midnight Market for a surprisingly reasonable rate. He knows the overwhelming sense of luxury only serves to drive up bidding at the evening’s climax. seCurIty Mister Kernaghan’s attendees expect certain stan- dards and he has no intention of falling prey to thieves. Danger Gal has the retainer and provides heavy security, both on the door and inside the Market. The entrance and the auction floor are staffed by armed guards in neatly pressed uniforms who are polite right up until the moment they’re not. Inside, undercover detectives mingle with the rich and powerful around the shops and stalls, ready to pounce and remove undesirables before they can disturb the guests. DD Twenty different possible vendors working at Mister Kernighan’s Midnight Market were introduced in the Cyberpunk RED Data Pack and some are referenced here. GMs, feel free to make up your own! Mister Kernaghan was first introduced in the Welcome to Night City chapter of the Cyberpunk RED core rulebook. 145 NIGHT MARKETS Seriously wounded Death save HP INt 8 5 6 7 8 8 5 6 4 STATS weapons armor skill bases 23 6 45 militech fox dual ammo pistol (ex Quality) ROF2 3d6 none — — t&c executive armor (body) SP 11 — Accounting 14•Athletics 8•Basic Tech 10•Brawling 8•Bribery 14•Bureaucracy 16•Business 14•Concentration 10 Conversation 12•Deduction 10•Drive Land Vehicle 10•Education 14•Evasion 14•First Aid 9•Handgun 10 Human Perception 12•Interrogation 12•Language (English) 12•Language (Japanese) 12•Language (Polish) 12 Language (Russian) 12•Language (Spanish) 12•Language (Streetslang) 10•Language (Swahili)•Language (Yurok) 12 Local Expert (Night City) 16•Personal Grooming 12•Perception 14•Perception 14•Persuasion 16•Resist Torture/Drugs 12 Stealth 8•Streetwise 14•Wardrobe & Style 12 GEAR Armor-Piercing Heavy Pistol Ammo x20•Incendiary Heavy Pistol Ammo x20•Bug Detector•Disposable Cellphone x2 Grapple Gun•Smart Glasses w/ Anti-Dazzle and Chyron•Street King Combat Vehicle•Trauma Team (Executive) cyberware Biomonitor•Contraceptive Implant•Enhanced Antibodies•Nasal Filters•Neural Link w/ Sandevistan•Toxin Binders reF dex teCH Cool wIll Move Body eMp MISTER KERNIGHAN fixer: OperatOr 9 5roleREP — 1 2 DD 1: Fashion and Armor 2: Weapons 3: Vehicles A B C D E 3 F G H I A: Angelo’s (restaurant) B: Forever Friends (drone pets) C: Kimiko’s (kimonos) D: The Birdcage (exotic dancing) E: Plein Air Gallery (art gallery) F: Mr. K’s Suite G: Auction Storage H: Auction Hall I: Security Office 148 NIGHT MARKETS M s. Mynah’s Night Market m y s m y n a h s n i gh t mar k e t The atmosphere in Ms. Mynah’s Night Market is generally convivial and pleasantly bustling, like an old-fashioned souk or bazaar without the old-fash- ioned inconveniences. Trusted customers can come in, show their passcodes to the polite security stationed at the entrance, and then shop at will. FrequeNCy Ms. Mynah keeps an office at Minamallism and can be found there most days but she only runs her Night Market one day a month, always on the fifth. wHo ruNs It? Ms. Mynah, a Fixer known for her striking avian-fea- tured bodysculpt, runs the Night Market thanks to the inspiration of her grandmother, who would wax lyrical about the many dazzling markets in her home city of Mumbai, and how you could go from one end of those bazaars to another and get all the finery required to dress up for an elaborate Desi wedding. wHat does It sell? Ms. Mynah curates the stalls at her Night Market according to the romantic traditions she learned from her grandmother. She rents out excess space to other Fixers or trusted vendors to provide the right mix of food, drink, goods, and services needed to encourage customers to linger and spend well. At Ms. Mynah’s Night Market, a customer can have their measurements taken in an automated measuring booth. Vendors with pattern-drafting software, CNC laser-cutting rigs, and skilled stitchers on their payroll will then begin the fabrication of a unique outfit or custom-tailor existing clothing. Said customer can then go off to other stalls to enjoy shopping and beverages before returning for a final fitting. This is all quite convenient for those who have the Eurobucks to spend on custom clothing, but shoppers of lesser liquidity can still find a plethora of ready-to- wear looks, freshly unearthed from various shipping containers or assembled and reassembled from recycled and reclaimed fabric with the additions of 3D-printed lace and patchwork applique. Ms. Mynah often beats other Fixers to the most recent fashion looks by dint of logistics — she has close ties to Fixie, who runs a city-wide network of street couriers, and she pays well for informa- tion leading to the acquisition of new fashion goods. wHere Is It Held? Ms. Mynah’s Night Market is located in a vast, sprawl- ing building in Rancho Coronado, formerly called Minimallism. The mall was unfortunately abandoned in the 4th Corporate War as supplies dried up and the stores became unprofitable. What was left of its infra- structure was left locked up behind vast metal shutters, untouched for years as people fled the area. A decade after, however, various squatters moved in, and, later, Reclaimers used the building’s empty spaces as garden space to grow food. They began trading excess food to Nomads, eventually bringing the Fixers in. Now Minimallism has become a patchwork of Night Markets between guerrilla gardener territories. Various Fixers pay the Reclaimer families in fertilizer or in parts to occupy space in the vast mall building, so much so that the whole complex is now referred to as the RC Night Market. How do you sCore aN INvIte? Admission to Ms. Mynah’s Night Market is by invitation only: Every month, a lucky five hundred customers are sent a passcode via Zchat, a Ziggurat app. gettINg IN oN tHe aCtIoN Fixers looking to share space at Ms. Mynah’s Night Market should approach the matter much like one approaches an epic romance. Move slowly, be courteous, offer gifts, and prove your trustworthiness. Ms. Mynah will accept Fixers of any Operator Rank so long as she believes them to be worthy of the opportunity and capable of offering an exceptional experience to her customers. seCurIty Security, made up of competent, polite Edgerunners, will turn away anyone without an invitation. Ms. Mynah employs only vetted Edgerunners on her contacts list as security. She usually chooses either people who owe her a favor or who can be paid in kind, with a new outfit or new fashionware, to cut down on overhead. Security gates cut off access to the majority of the mall complex, so Market customers won’t wander off and bother the Reclaimers farming there. EE Ms. Mynah was first introduced in Haven’t Got a Stitch to Wear, a mission in Tales of the RED: Street Stories. 149 NIGHT MARKETS Seriously wounded Death save HP INt 6 5 5 3 7 8 8 5 6 STATS weapons armor skill bases 20 5 40 martial arts attack ROF2 2d6 none — — tech upg montage variable (body) SP 12 — — Athletics 7•Basic Tech 6•Brawling 7•Bribery 13•Bureaucracy 10•Business 13•Concentration 10•Conversation 9•Dance 8 Human Perception 12•Language (English) 12•Language (Hindi) 12•Language (Spanish) 12•Language (Streetslang) 10 Language (Urdu) 12•Local Expert (Rancho Coronado) 15•Martial Arts (Taekwondo) 12•Personal Grooming 10•Resist Torture/Drugs 12 Stealth 7•Streetwise 12•Trading 15•Wardrobe & Style 12 GEAR Agent•Bug Detector•Computer•Disposable Cellphone x3•Memory Chips x5•Radio Communicator w/ Scambler/Descrambler cyberware Contraceptive Implant•Cybereye x2 w/ Chyron and Low Light/Infrared/UV reF dex teCH Cool wIll Move Body eMp MS.

A haze of tobacco smoke (or an artificially scented substitute) hangs in the air, almost thick enough to dim the light of the antique chandelier hanging from the ceiling. The floor is carpeted with a bold red pattern and vendors in dress shirts and vests preside over repurposed card and craps tables, wares spread out against the felt tops, and glittering in the light of strategically placed LEDs. There’s even a bar and overpriced liquor on a mirrored shelf behind a polished countertop that’s nearly indistinguishable from real wood. Glitz and glam and that old Vegas style, all crammed into the renovated basement of an abandoned build- ing. Say what you will about Rex Royale, but he’s sure as hell dedicated to his theme — if you’re planning on attending, you’d best have a suit or cocktail dress on hand. FrequeNCy Rex holds a Night Market as often as he has the time and goods to, which usually shakes out to roughly once a month. If he gets a big shipment in or needs to shift cargo quick, it might just pop up sooner. A man’s gotta keep things moving, y’know. wHo ruNs It? Rex Royale is the boss of this Night Market. Don’t let the weight and the balding-white-guy combover deceive you; Rex is an accomplished Fixer who runs a highly effective protection racket in the One Block neighborhood near the spot where the Upper Marina, Little China, and the Hot Zone intersect. He outfits his enforcers with the guns and body armor he trades in, and his garishly dressed mercenaries are a common sight on the neighborhood streets. Over the years, Rex has developed a particular fondness for One Block and has even taken on certain aspects of community management. Whether you believe his one-man HOA scheme to be a convenience or a pain in the ass, there’s no denying his mercs do hold off the worst of the overflow from Combat Zones and the Hot Zone. Let’s all just hope he doesn’t get interested in setting noise ordinances. wHat does It sell? Rex’s Casino sells what he does: body armor and weapons, the gaudier, the better, but occasionally he turns out other goods, too, if the opportunity presents itself. There are rumors that Rex’ll provide a discount if you can beat him in a game of chance, but Rex likes to collect his winnings in favors instead of ebs — and you know the saying, choomba: the house always wins. wHere Is It Held? Rex rarely holds his Market in the same place twice; all his fancy furnishings, including the carpet, live in the back of a truck when not in use, and the chandelier’s been retro- fitted to run on batteries in case the power goes out at his latest locale. He prefers abandoned buildings with sturdy basements, and he tries to keep his Market north of the border between Little China and the Upper Marina just in case trouble makes its way up from the south. How do you sCore aN INvIte? The invitees to Rex’s Markets are hand picked; if you want an invite, you want to be on his good side. In keeping with the casino theme, Rex’s invitations are personally signed playing cards from a specially marked deck, and he usually hands them out in person. He only issues fifty-two invites for each of his Markets. Attendees are allowed to bring a guest or two — though, as Rex likes to put it, there’s no jokers allowed. gettINg IN oN tHe aCtIoN Rex will happily take on additional Fixers with an Operator Rank of 4 or higher to run a table at his Casino and sell their own wares. When it comes to “partners”, Rex favors poker buddies. Here’s a tip. If you want to win a table? Don’t win the game. seCurIty No one should be surprised security at the Night Market is handled by Rex’s enforcers. The man likes to keep a tight grip on his events. Most nights, his mercs use the wares being sold, lending a certain ambiance to the proceedings, not to mention advertising credibility! The leader of the group is a Solo named Grant Jung, who uses the handle Royal. Grant’s a somber man, but he’s friendly enough when approached off-duty, and he loves a game of cards nearly as much as his boss. FF Rex Royale and his head Solo, Royale, were first introduced in the Cyberpunk RED Jumpstart Kit. 153 NIGHT MARKETS Seriously wounded Death save HP INt 7 7 7 4 8 6 4 6 4 STATS weapons armor skill bases 20 6 40 kendachi mono-three ROF1 4d6 tech upg ex Quality westwood ROF1 4d6 subdermal armor (head) SP 11 tech upg nu-tek corp isle (body) SP 12 Athletics 9•Brawling 13•Bribery 12•Conceal/Reveal Object 15•Concentration 8•Conversation 6•Education 9•Evasion 13 First Aid 6•Gamble 17•Handgun 16•Human Perception 6•Language (English) 11•Language (Cantonese) 11 Language (Italian) 11•Language (Japanese) 11•Language (Korean) 11•Language (Russian) 11•Language (Spanish) 11 Language (Streetslang) 9•Lip Reading 9•Local Expert (Little China) 13•Local Expert (University District) 13 Local Expert (Upper Marina) 13•Melee Weapon 16•Perception 11•Persuasion 14•Resist Torture/Drugs 10•Stealth 9 Streetwise 14•Trading 16•Wardrobe & Style 10 GEAR Basic Very Heavy Pistol Ammo x12•Agent•Deck of Cards•Smart Glasses w/ Image Enhance TetraCorp America Badger Corporate Bus cyberware Contraceptive Implant•Cybereye x2 w/ Hardened Cybereye Casing x2 and Low Light / Infrared / UV x2•Shift Tacts x2 Subdermal Armor reF dex teCH Cool wIll Move Body eMp REX ROYALE fixer: OperatOr 8 7roleREP *Tech UpG = This item has been upgraded in some way using a Tech’s Maker ability. 1 2 5 FF 1: Cyberware 2: Longarms 3: Armor 4: Other Gear 5: Handguns 3 4 156 NIGHT MARKETS O ther Places to Get Stuff o th e r pl a c e st o g e tst uff Besides Fixers and their Night Markets and Techs and their workshops, where else do the good citizens of Night City get their stuff? Well, so long as that stuff is 100eb (Premium) or less? They probably get it from a store. What’s that, you say? Everyone knows there aren’t any stores in Night City? That’s where you’re wrong, choomba. Sure, the supply chains aren’t strong enough to support thriving, oversized chain monstrosities but there’s still stores of various kinds peddling goods in the Dark Future. Here’s a few examples. oasIs Think of a convenience store. They’re like a little super- market, right? That’s an Oasis. Owned and operated by Continental Brands, Oasis seeks to dominate the market by being the only source of food and other daily essentials available. Of course, you’ll only find products produced by Continental Brands or their Corporate allies, such as Militech Urban Avenger ammunition and SovOil all-plastic toothbrushes but almost all your day- to-day needs can be met by shopping at a single Oasis. HuNdred uNder HaveN Also known as the Euro Shop, this small Petrochem-owned chain opened several storefronts in various Pacifica Confederation and Texas Free State cities over the last few years. The inventory’s ever-changing and reeks of cheap plastic, but everything’s under 100eb. Rumor has it, Angus Youngblood created the chain just to see how far up he could push Olivia Forsythe’s blood pressure. great rIver One of Night City’s newest shopping experiences, Great River is a pilot program designed and run by Ziggurat. Customers can order and pay for items via CitiNet and have them delivered directly by Transporter drone within an hour. Currently, the program has limited reach and will only deliver to parts of the various rebuilding urban centers. Bodegas Bodegas are locally owned corner markets stuffed inside a space smaller than the average Corp’s living room. Home to an ever-changing, random assortment of food and goods, bodegas serve as an alternative to the Megacorporate-dominated Oasis and a good source of community contact besides. Because Continental Brands serves as the biggest supplier of food in Night City, and they’re not interested in selling to competitors, the stuff you’ll find packing bodega shelves are often brands brought to Night City by Nomad caravans from Central and South America, Canada, and even Russia, Japan, and other points west. veNdIts Your friendly local machine full of all sorts of random, wacky fun protected by flamethrowers. In nicer neigh- borhoods, you’ll find little plazas stuffed with different vendits acting as a sort of do-it-yourself mini-mall. In rougher neighborhoods, you’ll find one or two vendits, often operated by local powers and protected by what- ever gangs they’ve paid off. Venditmobiles, trucks car- rying a variety of vendits stopping by neighborhoods for brief periods, are becoming increasingly popular with the children of Night City, who thrill to the sounds of their chiptune music blasting through the air. day MarKets Day Markets are the flipside of Night Markets. They’re relatively stable communal retail spaces filled with stalls, tables, and blankets selling goods of little interest to bigger fish, like Oasis. That’s everything from sec- ond-hand music chips to blankets woven from recycled plastic strips to fine “name brand” wallets. Much like the open-air bazaars and swap meets of old, these markets serve as a solid fixture in their respective communities, though the layout and vendors do change on the regular. pop-ups There’s a lot of empty commercial real estate in Night City and renting it out for short periods means more money to the landlord than not renting it out at all. Occasionally Megacorporations, local manufacturers, and even Fixers obtain an excess of a particular type of merchandise and need to unload it as quickly as possible. They’ll rent a space, set up a shop, sell until most of their inventory is gone, and vanish. The whole process takes just a few days. Some examples of pop-ups you might see in Night City include Militech Urban Avenger Ammo Stores in Watson, Everest VentureWare Survival Huts in Santo Domingo, and Nu-Tek’s annual candy and costume store, Ghostglobe Halloween, in Little Europe.
