E.g. Lists in Python • We often need to work with SUMS OF ELEMENTS IN AN ORDERED LIST − Many trigonometric functions, transcendental function, important mathematical constants, are defined in terms of summations over sequence of terms; not our concern in this topic though... Sequences: Definition • Sequences are ordered lists of elements. − 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 − 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, ... − order matters (1,2,3 is not the same as 1,3,2) − repetitions are allowed (and are “meaningful”, so 1,2,2,3 is not the same sequence as 1,2,3) − sometimes simply called “lists” • You can refer to the concept of “Lists” and “Array” data structures, which are very similar to the concept of “Sequences” we are discussing here Sequences: Definition; More Formal • Formally, a sequence (𝑎𝑛)𝑛=0 ∞ is a function over the natural numbers: 𝑎: ℕ ⟶ ℝ • Examples: − If 𝑎𝑛 is the sequence of all odd natural numbers, then (𝑎𝑛) = (1, 3, 5, … ). • That is, 𝑎𝑛 = 2𝑛 + 1 − The powers of 2: (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, … ). That is, 𝑎𝑛 = 2𝑛. 1 2 3 4 . . . a1 a2 a3 a4 . . . 𝑛 𝑎𝑛 Two Special Sequences • Arithmetic Progression • Geometric Progression Arithmetic Progression: Motivating Example • Arrays in memory start at a particular address − E.g. let’s say an Array A starts at address (in decimal): 1000 • Each element in the array is of a particular size − Say A is an array of integers, so each element’s size is 4 bytes (occupies 4 addresses) • In this scenario, the starting addresses of the elements in the array will form an arithmetic progression − Starting addresses of array: • 1000 • 1004 • 1008, • 1012, … − Or, equivalently: • 1000 + 𝟎 × 4 • 1000 + 𝟏 × 4, • 1000 + 𝟐 × 4 • 1000 + 𝟑 × 4, … − Direct formula for address of 𝑛𝑡ℎ element (where 𝑛 = 0,1,2, …): 1000 + 𝒏 × 4 Arithmetic Progression • An arithmetic progression is a sequence with a common, fixed difference between any two consecutive terms. • Therefore, it has the form 𝑎0, 𝑎0 + 𝑑, 𝑎0 + 2𝑑, 𝑎0 + 3𝑑, … where 𝑎0 is the initial term and 𝑑 is the difference. • That is, 𝒂𝒏 = 𝒂𝟎 + 𝒏𝒅 for all 𝒏 ∈ ℕ. • Examples ▪ 𝑎0 = 1 and 𝑑 = 1: (1, 2, 3, 4, … ) ▪ 𝑎0 = −1 and 𝑑 = −1: (−1, −2, −3, −4, … ) ▪ 𝑎0 = 1/2 and 𝑑 = 1/2: (1/2, 1, 3/2, 2, … ) ▪ 𝑎0 = 1000 and 𝑑 = 4: (1000, 1004, 1008, 1012, … ) Geometric Progression: Motivating Example • Any quantity going by a particular percentage at regular intervals • E.g., say population of a place is initially 100,000, and grows by 2% every year • So year-wise population ▪ 100,000 ▪ 100,000 × 1.02 ▪ 100,000 × 1.02 × 1.02 = 100,000 × 1.022 ▪ 100,000 × 1.02 × 1.02 × 1.02 = 100,000 × 1.023 • Population at year = n (where for first year, n = 0) ▪ 100,000 × 1.02𝑛 Geometric Progression: Another Motivating ExampleGeometric Progression • An geometric progression is a sequence with a common, fixed ratio between any two consecutive terms. • Therefore, it has the form 𝑎0, 𝑎0𝑟, 𝑎0 𝑟2, 𝑎0 𝑟3, … where 𝑎0 is the initial term and 𝑟 is the ratio. • That is, 𝒂𝒏 = 𝒂𝟎𝒓𝒏 for all 𝒏 ∈ ℕ. • Examples ▪ 𝑎0 = 1 and r= 2: (1, 2, 4, 8, … ) ▪ 𝑎0 = 1 and r= −1: (1, −1, 1, −1, … ) ▪ 𝑎0 = 1 and r= 1/2: (1, 1/2, 1/4, 1/8, … ) ▪ 𝑎0 = 100,000 and r= 1.02: (100000, 102000, 104040, 106121, … ) What to these progressions look like when plotted? • Download this spreadsheet, and experiment with − different values of a and d (for arithmetic progression) − different values of a and r (for geometric progression) RECURRENCE RELATIONS in Sequences Representing Sequences Sequences can sometimes be arbitrary with no “pattern”: E.g. A = {4, 7, 56, 12312, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2} We are more interested in Sequences that follow a certain PATTERN, where we can specify the terms by: a) defining terms in terms of previous terms(s) (recurrence relation) e.g. Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions, and/or b) giving a certain FORMULA for a term at any position we wish (i.e the nth term) – next subsection Representing Sequences: RULES / RECURRENCE RELATION We can define a Sequences by specifying a RULE to find successive elements. That is, we specify the first (or first few elements), and then define a recurrence relation on how to calculate subsequent terms. E.g. for the specifying the sequence of even numbers: Representing Sequences: RULES / RECURRENCE RELATION We can define a Sequences by specifying a RULE to find successive elements. That is, we specify the first (or first few elements), and then define a recurrence relation on how to calculate subsequent terms. E.g. for the specifying the sequence of even numbers: 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑛−1 + 2 𝑎0 = 0 = 0,2,4,6, … Recurrence Relations: Example 1 Let (𝒂𝒏) be a sequence defined by the recurrence relation What are the values of the terms 𝒂𝟏, 𝒂𝟐 and 𝒂𝟑 ? 𝑎0 = 2 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑛−1 + 3 Recurrence Relations: Example 1 Let (𝒂𝒏) be a sequence defined by the recurrence relation What are the values of the terms 𝒂𝟏, 𝒂𝟐 and 𝒂𝟑 ? ➢ Solution: We see from the recurrence relation that: 𝑎1 = 𝑎0 + 3 = 2 + 3 = 5 𝑎2 = 𝑎1 + 3 = 5 + 3 = 8 𝑎3 = 𝑎2 + 3 = 8 + 3 = 11 𝑎0 = 2 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑛−1 + 3 Recurrence Relations: Example 2 Let (𝒂𝒏) be a sequence defined by the recurrence relation What are the values of 𝒂𝟐 and 𝒂𝟑 ? ➢ Solution: 𝑎0 = 3 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑛−1 − 𝑎𝑛−2 𝑎1 = 5 (for 𝑛 = 2, 3, …) Recurrence Relations: Example 2 Let (𝒂𝒏) be a sequence defined by the recurrence relation What are the values of 𝒂𝟐 and 𝒂𝟑 ? ➢ Solution: We see from the recurrence relation that: 𝑎2 = 𝑎1 − 𝑎0 = 5 − 3 = 2 𝑎3 = 𝑎2 − 𝑎1 = 2 − 5 = −3 𝑎0 = 3 𝑎𝑛 = 𝑎𝑛−1 − 𝑎𝑛−2 𝑎1 = 5 (for 𝑛 = 2, 3, …) Recurrence Relation Example: Fibonacci Sequence The Fibonacci sequence (𝑓0 , 𝑓1 , 𝑓2, … ) is defined by: − Initial conditions: 𝑓0 = 0, 𝑓1 = 1 − Recurrence relation: 𝑓𝑛 = 𝑓𝑛−1 + 𝑓𝑛−2 𝑓2 = 𝑓1 + 𝑓0 = 1 + 0 = 1 𝑓3 = 𝑓2 + 𝑓1 = 1 + 1 = 2 𝑓4 = 𝑓3 + 𝑓2 = 2 + 1 = 3 𝑓5 = 𝑓4 + 𝑓3 = 3 + 2 = 5 𝑓6 = 𝑓5 + 𝑓4 = 5 + 3 = 8 “SOLVING” RECURRENCE RELATIONS Problem? • Say that, given a recurrence relation we want to find the nth element of a sequence (e.g. n = 1 billion) − You can consider the sequence of even numbers for illustration • We can find it through the use of recurrence relations, but we will have to compute the previous 999,999,999 elements first before we can compute the 1 billionth element • In other words, this is an O(n) computation • Can you tell me, directly, what the 1 billionth even number is? Simple Examples to Show we can do it! • The sequence is: natural numbers • The sequence is: even numbers • The sequence is: odd numbers • Yes, we can do it!
