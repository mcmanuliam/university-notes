A thread identifier, which is a pointer to a memory location of type pthread_t 2. Thread attributes which set properties such as scheduling policies or stack size (and passing NULL results in default attributes) 3. A function pointer to the start_routine This function takes a single argument of type void* and returns a value of type void* 4. The argument that is passed to start_routine (a pointer) • It returns 0 if the thread is created successfully or, else, a non-zero error code • Passing pointers to and from start_routine allows the passing of arbitrary data • It requires care to ensure that the memory locations pointed to have appropriate lifetimes int pthread_create(pthread_t *thread, const pthread_attr_t *attr, void *(*start_routine)(void*), void *arg); Systems Programming 8 #include <pthread.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <stdlib.h> #define NUM_THREADS 5 void *PrintHello(void *threadid) { long tid; tid = (long)threadid; printf(\"Hello World! It's me, thread #%ld!\\n\", tid); pthread_exit(NULL); } int main(int argc, char *argv[]) { pthread_t threads[NUM_THREADS]; int rc; long t; for(t=0;t<NUM_THREADS;t++){ printf(\"In main: creating thread %ld\\n\", t); rc = pthread_create(&threads[t], NULL, PrintHello, (void *)t); if (rc){ printf(\"ERROR; return code from pthread_create() is %d\\n\", rc); exit(-1); } } pthread_exit(NULL); } Passing an argument to a thread Systems Programming Waiting for Other Threads 9 • pthread_join() • Blocks the caller until the specified thread terminates • Only one joining thread per target is allowed • If the thread gave an exit code to pthread_exit(), it can be determined here Systems Programming Waiting for Other Threads 10 • To wait for another thread to terminate we use pthread_join • It takes two arguments: 1. A thread identifier (the thread we want to wait for) 2. A pointer to a memory location of type void* The return value of the start_routine (== a generic pointer), as passed to pthread_create, will be copied to this location • It returns 0 on success and, otherwise, a non-zero error code int pthread_join(pthread_t thread, void **value_ptr); Systems Programming Waiting for Another Thread 11 • Example of returning a single int value from a thread: int* return_value; int error = pthread_join(thread, (void**)&return_value); assert(error == 0); if (return_value) { printf(\"return_value: \\n\", *return_value); } // maybe: free(return_value); Systems Programming Waiting for Another Thread 12 struct results *results; int error = pthread_join(thread, (void**)&results); assert(error == 0); /* make use of results, but then also free(results) at some point */ void *thread_func(void *args) { /* ... */ /* Allocate heap space for this thread's results */ struct results *results = calloc(sizeof (struct results), 1); /* ... populate results struct ... */ /* Return the pointer to results */ pthread_exit(results); } Systems Programming Forking and Joining Threads 13 Main Thread Worker Thread pthread_create(..) pthread_join(..) pthread_exit(..) Systems Programming To Do Now 14 Completing this activity will support your understanding of the material today (before we have real lab time tomorrow!) In the “Lecture 2.2 files” folder on Moodle • Review the code for pthread_hello_world.c • Compile it and run it – don’t forget the “-lpthread” flag for clang (see Slide 5 for an example) • Add another print statement “Last thread about to die” just before the main thread terminates Systems Programming (Optional) Recommended Reading 15 • Blaise Barney, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, UCRL- MI-133316, POSIX Threads Programming, https://hpc- tutorials.llnl.gov/posix/, Section 5 for today and later Section 7 • Videos • Programming with Threads, Jacob Sorber, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9IEJIKnBJjFZxuqyJ9JqVYmuFZHr7 CFM • Unix Threads in C, CodeVault, https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqABt5AS4FmuQf70psXrsMLEDQX NkLq2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
