Dr Yiannis GiannakopoulosDr S Waqar Nabi Ethan HunterLaura Larios-Jones Lecturers: Tutors: What is an “Algorithm”? Setting the scene First: Defining “Algorithm” • Dictionary (common English) definition: • “A procedure for solving a (mathematical) problem in a finite number of steps that frequently involves repetitions of an operation; • broadly: a step-by-step method for accomplishing some task.” • E.g. • recipe for a dish • multiplying numbers https://learningsigns.speedofcreativity.org/category/cooking/ Importance of Algorithms “If we can specify an algorithm to solve a problem, then we can automate its solution.” What is Computer Science? And where do ALGORITHMS fit in the picture? One Definition of Computer Science places Algorithms at the heart of it[1] Computer Science is the study of Algorithms, including: 1. Their formal and mathematical properties • “Studying the behaviour of algorithms to determine whether they are correct and efficient”. 2. Their hardware realizations • “Designing and building computer systems that are able to execute algorithms”. 3. Their linguistic realizations • “Designing programming languages and translating algorithms into these languages so that they can be executed by the hardware”. 4. Their applications • “Identifying important problems, and designing correct and efficient software packages to solve these problems”. [added: Software Engineering may be viewed as having a higher emphasis on #4] ALGORITHMS & COMPUTERS - SOME BACK STORY “In 1812 he [Babbage] was sitting in his rooms in the Analytical Society looking at a table of logarithms, which he knew to be full of mistakes, when the idea occurred to him of computing all tabular functions by machinery. The French government had produced several tables by a new method. Three or four of their mathematicians decided how to compute the tables, half a dozen more broke down the operations into simple stages, and the work itself, which was restricted to addition and subtraction, was done by eighty computers who knew only these two arithmetical processes. Here, for the first time, mass production was applied to arithmetic, and Babbage was seized by the idea that the labours of the unskilled computers [people] could be taken over completely by machinery which would be quicker and more reliable.” [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage#cite_note-146] Some Key Figures 9 Ada Lovelace: Great Minds Why algorithms are called algorithms Also worth checking out: • The Big Bang - Ada Lovelace & Charles Babbage - Strange But True https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4kueyMImxhY • Early Computing: Crash Course Computer Science #1 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O5nskjZ_GoI • Logic (Podcast, “In our Times”) https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vcqcx Who Was Aristotle?
