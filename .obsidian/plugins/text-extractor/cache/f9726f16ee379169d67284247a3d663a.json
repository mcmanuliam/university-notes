Transactions and Views.pdf","text":"Data Storage and Retrieval Lecture 9 Transactions and Views Dr. Graham McDonald Graham.McDonald@glasgow.ac.uk 2 Why Transactions? • Database systems are normally being accessed by many users or processes at the same time. • Both queries and modifications. • Unlike operating systems, which support interaction of processes, a DMBS needs to keep processes from troublesome interactions. Controlled Concurrent Access • Databases can have many users reading and writing at the same time • We need to make sure that each view of the data is correct or consistent for each user • So that concurrent access does not cause incorrect updates 3 Example: Bad Interaction • Imagine a bank’s database of accounts • And the operation to withdraw £10 from a cash machine: X = Get_balance(); Set_balance(X-10); • Now what happens if Mr & Mrs Bloggs both withdraw £10 concurrently, i.e. at exactly the same time? 4 Customer Balance (£) Mr & Mrs Bloggs 100 … … X = Get_balance(); Set_balance(X-10);  Here, concurrent access resulted in an incorrect account balance being recorded 5 X=100 X = Get_balance(); Set_balance(X-10); X=100 Customer Balance (£) Mr & Mrs Bloggs 100 … … 90 Mr Bloggs Mrs Bloggs Example: Bad InteractionControlled Concurrent Access • Databases can have many users reading and writing at the same time • We need to make sure that each view of the data is correct or consistent for each user • So that concurrent access does not cause incorrect updates • DBMS have concurrent control software to ensure that several users updating the same data do so in a controlled manner • This happens through transactions, which make concurrent database interactions appear to happen independently & sequentially 67 Transactions • Transaction = process involving database queries and/or modification. • Normally with some strong properties regarding concurrency. • Formed in SQL from single statements or explicit programmer control. 8 ACID Transactions • ACID transactions are: • Atomic : Whole transaction or none is done. • Consistent : Database constraints preserved. • Isolated : It appears to the user as if only one process executes at a time. • Durable : Effects of a process survive a crash. • Optional: weaker forms of transactions are often supported as well. 9 Transaction Operations • An DBMS keeps track of when a transaction starts, terminates, and commits or aborts. • To do this, a recovery manager process tracks the following operations: • BEGIN_TRANSACTION • READ or WRITE • END_TRANSACTION • COMMIT_TRANSACTION • ROLLBACK 10 COMMIT • The SQL statement COMMIT causes a transaction to complete. • It’s database modifications are now permanent in the database. 11 ROLLBACK • The SQL statement ROLLBACK also causes the transaction to end, but by aborting. • No effects on the database. • Failures like division by 0 or a constraint violation can also cause rollback, even if the programmer does not request it. 12 Example: Interacting Processes • Assuming the relation Sells(bar,beer,price), and suppose that Joe’s Bar sells only 2 beers: • Bud for £2.50 and • Miller for £3.00. • Sally is querying Sells for the highest and lowest price Joe charges. • Joe decides to stop selling Bud and Miller, but to sell only Heineken at £3.50. 13 Sally’s Program • Sally executes the following two SQL statements called (min) and (max): (max) SELECT MAX(price) FROM Sells WHERE bar = ’Joe’s Bar’; (min) SELECT MIN(price) FROM Sells WHERE bar = ’Joe’s Bar’; 14 Joe’s Program • At about the same time, Joe executes the following steps: (del) and (ins). (del) DELETE FROM Sells WHERE bar = ’Joe’s Bar’; (ins) INSERT INTO Sells VALUES(’Joe’s Bar’, ’Heineken’, 3.50); 15 Interleaving of Statements • Although (max) must come before (min), and (del) must come before (ins), there are no other constraints on the order of these statements • Unless, we group Sally’s and/or Joe’s statements into transactions. 16 Example: Strange Interleaving • Suppose the steps execute in the order (max)(del)(ins)(min). Joe’s Prices: Statement: Result: • Sally sees MAX < MIN! {2.50,3.00} (del) (ins) {3.50} (min) 3.50 {2.50,3.00} (max) 3.00 17 Fixing the Problem with Transactions • If we group Sally’s statements (max)(min) into one transaction, then she cannot see this inconsistency. • She sees Joe’s prices at some fixed time. • Either before or after he changes prices, or in the middle, but the MAX and MIN are computed from the same prices. 18 Another Problem: Rollback • Suppose Joe executes (del)(ins), not as a transaction, but after executing these statements, thinks better of it and issues a ROLLBACK statement. • If Sally executes her statements after (ins) but before the rollback, she sees a value, 3.50, that never existed in the database. 19 Solution • If Joe executes (del)(ins) as a transaction, its effect cannot be seen by others until the transaction executes COMMIT. • If the transaction executes ROLLBACK instead, then its effects can never be seen. 20 Isolation Levels • SQL defines four isolation levels • READ_UNCOMMITTED • READ_COMMITTED • REPEATABLE_READ • SERIALIZABLE • Isolation levels are choices about what interactions are allowed by transactions that execute at about the same time. 21 Isolation Levels • Only the “serializable” level = ACID transactions. • Each DBMS implements transactions in its own way. 22 Choosing the Isolation Level • Within a transaction, we can say: SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL X where X = 1. SERIALIZABLE 2. REPEATABLE READ 3. READ COMMITTED 4. READ UNCOMMITTED 23 Serializable Transactions • If Sally = (max)(min) and Joe = (del)(ins) are each transactions, and Sally runs with isolation level SERIALIZABLE: • Sally will see the database either before or after Joe runs, but not in the middle. 24 Isolation Level Is Personal Choice • Your choice, e.g., run serializable, affects only how you see the database, not how others see it. • Example: If Joe Runs serializable, but Sally doesn’t, then Sally might see no prices for Joe’s Bar. • i.e., it looks to Sally as if she ran in the middle of Joe’s transaction. 25 Read-Commited Transactions • If Sally runs with isolation level READ COMMITTED, then she can see only committed data, but not necessarily the same data each time. • Example: Under READ COMMITTED, the interleaving (max)(del)(ins)(min) is allowed. • As long as Joe commits, Sally sees MAX < MIN. 26 Repeatable-Read Transactions • Repeatable-read is like read-committed, plus: • If data is read again, then everything seen the first time will be seen the second time. • But the second and subsequent reads may see more tuples as well. 27 Example: Repeatable Read • Suppose Sally runs under REPEATABLE READ, and the order of execution is (max)(del)(ins)(min). • (max) sees prices 2.50 and 3.00. • (min) can see 3.50, but must also see 2.50 and 3.00, because they were seen on the earlier read by (max). 28 Read Uncommitted • A transaction running under READ UNCOMMITTED can see data in the database, even if it was written by a transaction that has not committed (and may never). • Example: If Sally runs under READ UNCOMMITTED, she could see a price 3.50 even if Joe later aborts. 30 Views • A view is a relation defined in terms of stored tables (called base tables ) and other views. • There are two kinds of views: 1. Virtual = not stored in the database; just a query for constructing the relation. 2. Materialized = actually constructed and stored. 31 Declaring Views • Declare by: CREATE [MATERIALIZED] VIEW <name> AS <query>; • Default is virtual. 32 Example: View Definition • CanDrink(drinker, beer) is a view “containing” the drinker-beer pairs such that the drinker frequents at least one bar that serves the beer: CREATE VIEW CanDrink AS SELECT drinker, beer FROM Frequents, Sells WHERE Frequents.bar = Sells.bar; 33 Example: Accessing a View • Query a view as if it were a base table. • Also: a limited ability to modify views if it makes sense as a modification of one underlying base table. • Example query: SELECT beer FROM CanDrink WHERE drinker = ’Sally’; 34 Triggers on Views • Generally, it is impossible to modify a virtual view, because it doesn’t exist. • But an INSTEAD OF trigger lets us interpret view modifications in a way that makes sense. • Example: View Synergy has (drinker, beer, bar) triples such that the bar serves the beer, the drinker frequents the bar and likes the beer. 35 Example: The View CREATE VIEW Synergy AS SELECT Likes.drinker, Likes.beer, Sells.bar FROM Likes, Sells, Frequents WHERE Likes.drinker = Frequents.drinker AND Likes.beer = Sells.beer AND Sells.bar = Frequents.bar; Natural join of Likes, Sells, and Frequents Pick one copy of each attribute 36 Interpreting a View Insertion • We cannot insert into Synergy --- it is a virtual view. • But we can use an INSTEAD OF trigger to turn a (drinker, beer, bar) triple into three insertions of projected pairs, one for each of Likes, Sells, and Frequents. • Sells.price will have to be NULL. 37 The Trigger CREATE TRIGGER ViewTrig INSTEAD OF INSERT ON Synergy REFERENCING NEW ROW AS n FOR EACH ROW BEGIN INSERT INTO LIKES VALUES(n.drinker, n.beer); INSERT INTO SELLS(bar, beer) VALUES(n.bar, n.beer); INSERT INTO FREQUENTS VALUES(n.drinker, n.bar); END; 38 Materialized Views • Problem: each time a base table changes, the materialized view may change. • Cannot afford to recompute the view with each change. • Solution: Periodic reconstruction of the materialized view, which is otherwise “out of date.” 39 Example: Mailing List • The mailing list of the (fictional) class cs1Q is a materialized view of the class enrollment in the DBMS. • It is updated four times a day. • You can enroll and miss an email sent out after you enroll. 40 Example: A Data Warehouse • A retailer stores every sale at every store in a database. • Overnight, the sales for the day are used to update a data warehouse • The data warehouse is in effect materialized views of the sales. • The warehouse is used by analysts to predict trends and move goods to where they are selling best.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
