For reference: https://dlnext.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/2556288.2557033 Perception and Ambiguity • Illusions work when our perception fills the gaps in ambiguous stimuli • Ponzo lines demonstrate how our depth perception changes how we look at the two black lines • There are illusions that can trick our visual, aural, and haptic senses Cognition • Human process of conscious intellectual activity • Thinking, reasoning, deciding Memory • Ability to store, retain, and recall information • Short term memory capacity 7 ± 2 • Has often been used to guide UI design, eg number menu items • Might be misunderstanding the original intent • Shorter menus probably still good though!Human Performance Lecture 4 Human Performance • Speed Accuracy Tradeoff – tasks completed faster are more error prone • People often prioritise speed or accuracy differently based on context • Most of early HCI measured this, but still important and studied today • E.g. performance with various input devices • But also augment overall human performance, e.g. find answers to questions with visualisation tool vs looking at raw numbers Reaction Time • Different sensory modalities have different reaction times • 150ms audio • 200ms visual • 300ms smell • 700ms pain • Visual search is another example of reaction which includes more complex cognition that simply responding to stimuli Skilled Behaviour • In most tasks beyond simple responses, human performance can increase with practice • Like playing darts and playing chess • Playing darts requires training of your sensor/motor skill • Playing chess requires training of your mental skill • Some tasks require both Attention • When task performance degrades with performed simultaneously with another, we can say that task requires attention • Consider walking and talking • Consider reading and talking • Driving and talking? Attention • Divided attention is concentrating/performing more than one task at a time • Typically, this will degrade performance, which is not an option in safety critical contexts like driving • Focused attention is attending to one task to the exclusion of all others • The ability to ignore external events not always possible or feasible • In a noisy room, you might be able to have a conversation but are likely to be distracted at times. • Sensory modalities are often thought of as channels, but in practice it is not so simple Human Error • Error is a discrete event in a task where the outcome is incorrect or deviates from the desired outcome • In practice, this kind of coarse measure of error provides a limited understanding • Consider the Key Stroke dataset • “error” in this sense isn’t even reported in this dataset, although it’s simple to calculate • We are often trying to measure something more complicated than % of errors Questions?

As a group, put your individual answers together in a table to get an average time for your group. • Test your reaction time to sound: https://playback.fm/audio-reaction- time three times individually. As a group, put your individual answers together in a table to get an average time for your group. • Find out which one as a group you react towards fastest, post these two tables on your Teams space as well as a few sentences on what you found and how this human performance would impact how you make interactive computers for humans, e.g., auditory vs visual notifications.
