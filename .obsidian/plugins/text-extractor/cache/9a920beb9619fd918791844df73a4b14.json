PA ... my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 15) my_X = my_X - 15 shared_mem.X = my_X ... PB Systems Programming Another Shared Memory Example 5 • Consider two threads T0 and T1 attempting to increment a count variable with a C compiler that implements count++ as register1 = count register1 = register1 + 1 count = register1 • Consider this execution interleaving with “count = 5” initially: T0: register1 = count {T0 register1 = 5} T0: register1 = register1 + 1 {T0 register1 = 6} T1: register1 = count {T1 register1 = 5} T1: register1 = register1 + 1 {T1 register1 = 6} T1: count = register1 {count = 6} T0: count = register1 {count = 6} Q: Should the value of count be 6? What has gone wrong? How can we fix it? Systems Programming And One More! 6 • Consider a singly linked list: • Two threads simultaneously start removing the elements from the list. • The first thread removes “b” by moving the next pointer of “a” to “c”: • The second thread removes “c” by moving the next pointer of “b” to “d”: • The resulting list is inconsistent, i.e. it still contains node “c” (the item deleted by the second thread)! • We can avoid inconsistency by ensuring that simultaneous updates to the same part of the list cannot occur Systems Programming A Race Condition 7 • A race condition refers to a dependency on the execution sequence (or scheduling) of multiple processes/threads • A race condition is a problem as soon as one or more of the possible outcomes is undesirable Systems Programming Shared Memory Example Revisited 8 • How would you alleviate this problem? • Critical Section: A section of code where a process accesses shared resources • Shared memory, variables, database, file, … • Goal: No two processes should be in their critical section at the same time ... my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 10): my_X = my_X - 10 shared_mem.X = my_X ... PACritical Section ... entry section my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 10): my_X = my_X - 10 shared_mem.X = my_X exit section ... PA Systems Programming Critical Section Solution Properties 9 • Mutual exclusion: No two processes are in their critical section at the same time • Progress: Entering one’s critical section should only be decided by its contenders and in due time (assuming no process already in its critical section); a process cannot immediately re-enter its critical section if other processes are waiting for their turn • Bounded waiting: It should be impossible for a process to wait indefinitely to enter its critical section, if other processes are allowed to do so Systems Programming Peterson’s Solution 10 • Mutual exclusion: If PA is in its critical section, then either flag_B = False (i.e., PB is out of its critical section) or turn = A (i.e., PB is waiting in the while loop) • Progress: PA cannot immediately reenter its critical section, as turn = B means PB will be given the go next • Bounded waiting: PA will wait at most one turn before it can enter its critical section again ... flag_A = True turn = B while flag_B == True and turn == B: pass my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 10): my_X = my_X - 10 shared_mem.X = my_X flag_A = False ... PA ... flag_B = True turn = A while flag_A == True and turn == A: pass my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 10): my_X = my_X - 10 shared_mem.X = my_X flag_B = False ... PB Systems Programming Outline • Race Conditions and Critical Sections • Atomic Instructions, Mutexes, Semaphores • Semaphore Examples • Starvation, Livelock, Priority Inversion, Deadlock Systems Programming Peterson’s Solution 12 • Is that good enough? • Busy waiting: the waiting process eats up CPU cycles unnecessarily (a.k.a., spinlock) • Memory reordering: Modern CPUs tend to reorder the execution of memory accesses (to avoid pipeline stalls) • Better solution: atomic instructions at the hardware level • “Test and set” • “Compare and swap” test_and_set(value): my_value = value value = True return my_value compare_and_swap(value, expected, new_value): my_value = value if value == expected: value = new_value return my_value value passed by reference Systems Programming Peterson’s Solution Revisited 13 • Mutual Exclusion: Only one process will execute test_and_set or compare_and_swap with the lock value originally being False • Progress/Bounded waiting: There is nothing stopping a process from immediately re-entering its critical section! ... while test_and_set(lock) == True: pass my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 10): my_X = my_X - 10 shared_mem.X = my_X lock = False ... test_and_set ... while compare_and_swap(lock, False, True) == True: pass my_X = shared_mem.X if (my_X >= 10): my_X = my_X - 10 shared_mem.X = my_X lock = False ... compare_and_swap test_and_set(value): my_value = value value = True return my_value compare_and_swap(value, expected, new_value): my_value = value if value == expected: value = new_value return my_valuelockunlocklockunlock Systems Programming Beyond test_and_set and compare_and_swap 14 • Test_and_set / compare_and_swap work, but are a bit clunky and low-level • Alternative: mutex locks and semaphores • Internal state: a single integer value • For mutexes can only take values 0 or 1, for semaphores only values >= 0 • API offers two atomic functions: • But still busy waiting/spinlocking? • Can augment semaphores with a list of blocked processes each: • wait(semaphore) would instead add processes to said list if value is <= 0 • signal(semaphore) would instead remove one process from said queue acquire(mutex): while mutex == 0: pass mutex = 0 release(mutex): mutex = 1 wait(semaphore): while semaphore <= 0: pass semaphore -= 1 signal(semaphore): semaphore += 1 Systems Programming Semaphore Usage 15 • Set semaphore value to number or size of shared resources (i.e., number of acceptable concurrent users of the resource) • 1 if only 1 user is allowed, N for an N-sized queue, etc. • Decrease (wait) the semaphore every time a resource is used • Increase (signal) the semaphore every time a resource is released wait(semaphore): while semaphore <= 0: pass semaphore -= 1 signal(semaphore): semaphore += 1 Systems Programming Outline • Race Conditions and Critical Sections • Atomic Instructions, Mutexes, Semaphores • Semaphore Examples • Starvation, Livelock, Priority Inversion, Deadlock Systems Programming Bounded Buffer Problem 17 • Also known as the producer-consumer problem • Assume a list where items are placed by producers, and removed by consumers • Assume we want our list to never contain more than N items • Goal: Allow producers of items to add them to the list, but have them wait first if the list is full • Goal: Allow consumers of items to remove an item from the list, but have them wait first if the list is empty semaphore mutex = 1 semaphore empty = N semaphore full = 0 producer(): while True: # Produce an item wait(empty) wait(mutex) # Add item to list signal(mutex) signal(full) consumer(): while True: wait(full) wait(mutex) # Remove an item from list signal(mutex) signal(empty) # Do stuff with item Reading hint: • empty: list is still a bit empty • full: list is still at least a bit full • Starts fully empty, can become fully full (N transferred from empty to full) Systems Programming Why Protect the List? 18 • Consider a singly linked list • What happens if two processes simultaneously add an element? a b c NULL a b c NULLd a b c NULLe Systems Programming … also for Removing an Element 19 • Consider a singly linked list • What happens if two processes simultaneously remove the last element? a b c NULL a b NULL a b NULL Systems Programming … and Producing and Consuming? 20 • Consider a singly linked list • What happens if two processes simultaneously produce and consume? a b NULL c NULL1 a b c NULL Systems Programming Readers-Writers Problem 21 • Assume a variable shared among many processes, some of which only read its value (readers) while others also need to update it (writers) • Goal 1: When a writer accesses the variable, no other process should be able to either read or update it • Goal 2: When a reader accesses the variable, more readers can also access it, but writers should wait until no reader accesses it semaphore rw_mutex = 1 semaphore mutex = 1 int read_count = 0 writer(): while True: wait(rw_mutex) # Update the value signal(rw_mutex) reader(): while True: wait(mutex) read_count += 1 if (read_count == 1) wait(rw_mutex) signal(mutex) # Read value wait(mutex) read_count -= 1 if (read_count == 0) signal(rw_mutex) signal(mutex) Systems Programming Outline • Race Conditions and Critical Sections • Atomic Instructions, Mutexes, Semaphores • Semaphore Examples • Starvation, Livelock, Priority Inversion, Deadlock Systems Programming Matters of Life and Death 23 • What would happen to writers if readers keep on arriving at the system? • Writers would “starve” • Starvation: Processes/threads unable to enter their critical section because of “greedy” contenders • Analogy: trying to get on an extremely busy motorway with no one giving you some space • Livelock: a special case of starvation where competing parties both try to “avoid” each other at the same time • Analogy: bumping into a person in a corridor, then both going left/right at the same time only to bump into each other again • Priority inversion: a special case of starvation where a lower priority process keeps a higher priority process waiting • Analogy: having to sleep but being kept awake by social media notifications… Systems Programming Matters of Life and Death 24 • What would happen in the producer/consumer problem if order of locking/unlocking mutex and empty/full was reversed? • Assume a consumer goes first… • mutex → locked; consumer waiting on full • producer waiting on mutex • Deadlock: all parties of a group waiting indefinitely for another party (incl. themselves) to take action • e.g. each of two threads waiting for a resource held by the other thread semaphore mutex = 1 semaphore empty = N semaphore full = 0 producer(): while True: # Produce an item wait(mutex) wait(empty) # Add item to list signal(full) signal(mutex) consumer(): while True: wait(mutex) wait(full) # Remove an item from list signal(empty) signal(mutex) # Do stuff with item Systems Programming Beyond Semaphores… 25 • Semaphores/mutexes allow for mutual exclusion, but once a process is blocked, that’s it! • Monitors: A combination of semaphores and condition variables • Each condition variable “associated” with a semaphore • Allows for processes to have both mutual exclusion and wait (block) on a condition • cond_wait(condvar, mutex): unlock the mutex to wait for a condition, then atomically reacquire the mutex when condition is met • cond_signal(condvar): unblock one of the processes waiting on condition semaphore mutex = 1 condvar empty = N condvar full = 0 list items = 0 producer(): while True: # Produce an item wait(mutex) while len(items) == N: cond_wait(empty, mutex) # Add item to list cond_signal(full) signal(mutex) consumer(): while True: wait(mutex) while len(items) == 0: cond_wait(full, mutex) # Remove an item from list cond_signal(empty) signal(mutex) # Do stuff with item Systems Programming Food for Thought: Dining Philosphers 26 • Philosophers sitting on a round table, plates in front of them, but only as many chopsticks as there are philosophers (as in the image) • Philosophers spend the most time thinking, but now and then get hungry • They need two chopsticks to eat and will not grab a chopstick from their neighbour’s hand • Philosophers can only pick up one chopstick at a time • When done eating, they will put the chopsticks back on the tableSource: A.
