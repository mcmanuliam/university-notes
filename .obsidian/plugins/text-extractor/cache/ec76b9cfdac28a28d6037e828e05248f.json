Revision & Example Exams 3 Statistics for User Studies Lecture 9 4 Analysing Data from User Studies • Providing “descriptive statistics” of quantitative data is the bare minimum in quantitative contexts (not always needed!) • Average, distribution, standard deviation • Helps us to • make claims • infer causal relationships • hypothesis test • Goal: Have you shown that your product is “better”? 5 • How to determine? • From the types of computations possible with each measurement • Nature of data 6 Measurement ScalesMeasurement Scales • Nominal / categorical • Labels or names • These could be numbers; but can’t do computations with them. • E.g. Happy, sad labels. ID numbers • Ordinal • Can put the values in a ranking, but not equally spaced • e.g. ordered list of favourite films • Can do > or < comparisons, but not valid to calculate means 7 Measurement Scales • Interval • Equal distances between adjacent values, but no absolute zero • Can compute mean • E.g., Rating scale • Sometimes treated as Ordinal or Interval: • Important to know which if you want to compute means. • Treating as Interval OK if options are equally spaced and centred at neutral value. 8 Measurement Scales • Ratio • Do have absolute zero • e.g. time, distance, counts of events • Support many calculations • add, divide, mean, standard deviation 9 Population and Sample • Limited access to Population (all) • We use of Samples (subset) → Proxy for Population • Task Measurement • Estimation → The average result from the sample is used to estimate the average result for the entire user population. 10 Descriptive Statistics 11 Descriptive Statistics • Measures of Central Tendency: Mean, Median, and Mode • The mean is simple to calculate, but also provide little (or potentially misleading) information • Typically only useful if normally distributed data • The median may differ significantly from the mean, and this can insight into the “shape” of the data • Standard Deviation describes the spread of the data • Estimate of average difference of values from the mean • Plotting distributions tells you much more than simple values 12 • 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 = 𝑠𝑢𝑚 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑛𝑢𝑚𝑏𝑒𝑟 → mean of 2, 4, 6 is 2+4+6 3 = 4 • Median = middle number of sorted values of 1, 3, 5 is 3 • Mode = data point which occurs most; of 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4 is 4 13 Descriptive Statistics: Central Tendency Descriptive Statistics: Mean and Mode • Mean (X) = (5+5+3+3)/4 = 4 • Mean(Y) = (20+22+40+42)/4 = 31 • Modes? → No single mode as no repeating numbers! 14 Standard Deviation • Measure of how spread-out numbers are in a dataset. • It tells you how much the numbers vary from the average (mean). 1. Find mean 2. Find difference of each value from mean 3. Square differences 4. Add up all squared differences 5. Average 6. Take square root. 𝑆𝐷 = 1 𝑁 ෍ 𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑥𝑖 − 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 2 15 • Back to our example! • Mean (X) = 4 • Mean(Y) = 31 • SD(X) = 1 • SD(Y) = 10 → What does this tell us? → Is the SD large or small? 16 Standard Deviation • Standard deviation? • Spread of data • Consistency • Normal distribution? • Bell shaped, symmetrical curve • Common in nature! • Z-Score? • how many sample values fall within n std devs of mean • 0 → value is at mean • >0 → value is above mean • 𝑧 = 𝑉𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 − 𝑀𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑆𝑡𝐷𝑒𝑣 = 185 −170 10 17 Standard Deviation and Normal Distribution • Problem! → With human participants, the data is typically not normal distributed • Error Rate? • Outliers? • Multimodal? 18 Standard Deviation for Evaluation Data Data Skew 19 If you take many random samples from any population and calculate the mean of each sample, the distribution will be normal (bell- shaped, approximately), regardless of the original population's distribution. 20 Central Limit Theorem • Technically: As the sample size approaches infinity… • For us: > 30 (even smaller for interval data) • Even applies to binary data! Example: • Completion (y/n) • Completion rate 21 Central Limit TheoremCentral Limit Theorem: Implications • Many statistical hypothesis tests (e.g. t-test) assume normal distribution of data • If data non-normally distributed (e.g. skewed), will these tests be invalid? • If sample size is large enough, CLT tells us that the distribution of sample means approximate a normal distribution • And so, we can use these hypothesis tests! 22 Standard Error = standard deviation of means (plural!) 23 For reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A82brFpdr9g Standard Error 24 Standard Error 25 Standard Error 26 Standard Error 27 Standard Error 28 Standard Error • But we don’t want to • run multiple experiments • take multiple samples! • How we model standard error? → Estimate as: 𝑆𝐸 = 𝑆𝐷 𝑁 29 Why bother? Sample vs. Population! • Standard deviation is about variability within a single dataset → sample • Standard error is about precision of the sample mean as an estimate → population 30 t-distribution • We cannot always know about distributions, means, SD and so on of population, only our sample • Student’s t-distribution, t-scores rather than z-scores For reference: https://www.jmp.com/en/statistics-knowledge-portal/t-test/t-distribution 31 Hypothesis testing Statistically significant differences. 32 Hypothesis Testing • Hypothesis testing to prove something measurable about a system. • Start with key question, e.g. is A better than B? • Consider how you will measure “better”, • Does using A result in faster completion times than B? • Does using A lead to less errors than B? • Phrase this as a falsifiable statement, • e.g. There is no difference between A and B. (null hypothesis or 𝐻0) • Goal: Rejecting the null hypothesis → there’s a difference 33 Hypothesis Testing • We look for sufficient evidence (instead of definitive proof) • Science changes, often safer to say evidence rather than proof • Evidence to reject 𝐻0 • We use statistical test for those: there are lots! • What are stats tests testing and telling you? • How likely is it that two samples are from the same distribution • How confident are we that they’re different? → confidence interval • By how much are they different? → p-value 34 For reference: https://github.com/valentin-schwind/statistics-decision-tree Hypothesis Testing • Consider an example comparing a mouse to a trackpad Null hypothesis 𝐻0: There is no difference between user performance in using these two input devices for an object selection task. • Collect data about user performance for both devices. • Perform hypothesis testing. • See if we can reject null hypothesis 𝐻0 or not • Reject H0 → there is probably a difference • Fail to reject H0 → there’s probably no difference (but we don’t know) • How to do this test? 35 Hypothesis Testing: T-Tests • There are many different tests. One of the most common is t-test • Assumptions it makes: • Data follows a normal distribution • Data drawn from interval/ratio data • What it does: • Compares sample means • Computes our p-value • Computes confidence interval (CI) 36 reliability of the estimated mean • Value between 0 and 1 (percentage) • Lots of confusion about this! Careful! • “How likely it is to get this results if the 𝐻0 is true.” or “How likely is it that difference is by chance?” or “Low p means the null hypothesis unlikely to be true.” • In HCI: if < 0.05, less than 5% chance that difference is by chance → we reject 𝐻0 • Remember: 𝐻0 = no difference • p: Likelihood that difference is by chance. • Type 1: False Positive Acting on something that is not real. • Type 2: False Negative Missing something that is real. 37 Hypothesis Testing: ErrorsErrors in Statistical Testing • Type 1 and 2 errors can never be avoided entirely → can reduce their likelihood by increasing sample size. • Much of statistical theory is around avoided these two types of errors • Statistical tests by nature are probabilistic → we cannot know for certain whether conclusions are correct • Significance level can help with Type 1* (False Positives) with → 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the true null hypothesis • Adjusting significance level: reducing one increases the other 38 *Type 1: Incorrectly rejecting 𝐻0. Assuming there is a difference when there is none. Type 2: Incorrectly failing to reject 𝐻0. Assuming there is no difference when there is one Correlations Relationships between two variables 39 • Correlation coefficient (Pearson’s r) → measures statistical relationship between two variables: X and Y • E.g., from surveys you can get • X = rating of user satisfaction • Y = user age • Measures relationship strength and direction (positive or negative). • Practically, we will compute sample correlation coefficient • 𝑆𝑋,𝑌 = σ𝑖=1 𝑁 (𝑥𝑖 − ҧ𝑥)(𝑦𝑖 − 𝑦) → Sum of product of differences from mean • 𝑆𝑋,𝑋 = 1 𝑁 σ𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑥𝑖 − ҧ𝑥 2 → Sum of squares for X • 𝑆𝑌,𝑌 = 1 𝑁 σ𝑖=1 𝑁 𝑦𝑖 − ത𝑦 2 → Sum of squares for Y • → 𝑟(𝑋, 𝑌) = 𝑆𝑋,𝑌 𝑆𝑋𝑋 𝑆𝑌𝑌 40 Correlations: Relationships between two variables ҧ𝑥 = 𝑚𝑒𝑎𝑛 𝑜𝑓 𝑎𝑙𝑙 𝑥′ 𝑥𝑖 = 𝑖′𝑡ℎ 𝑥 𝑣𝑎𝑙𝑢𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑥 𝑁 = 𝑠𝑎𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑒 𝑠𝑖𝑧𝑒 Comparing Correlation Plots • Correlation coefficient (r) is between -1 to 1. • 1 means perfect positive correlation, -1 means perfect negative correlation, and 0 means no correlation. 41 Example Comparing Images: R 42 Example Comparing Images: R • Positive 43 Example Comparing Images: R • Positive 44 Example Comparing Images: R • Positive • No Correlation 45 Questions?
