First 2Then 6 Variable Lifetime • Variables are stored at locations in memory that do not change over their lifetimes o This depends on how the memory for the variable was allocated. There are 3 cases: 1. automatic: • Declared locally in a block (i.e. inside a pair of {}) • Their lifetime ends at the end of the block • All variables we have seen so far fall into this category 2. static: • Declared with the static keyword • …or defined at file-level outside all blocks • The lifetime is the entire execution of the program 3. allocated: • Explicit request of using dynamic memory allocation functions, such as malloc • We manage the lifetime of these variables ourselves (next lecture!)StackHeap make o GNU make is the most popular build system for C programs § automates the process of compiling programs § alternative build systems: Maven, Bazel, Ninja, … o A Makefile has the following structure: make o The first two lines form a rule that explain how a target is built o The first line is the dependency, made up of “[targets] : [sources]” o The target(s) depend on the source(s) § elements in each list are separated by a space o The following line(s) are the action § i.e. commands defining how the target is built § need to start with 1 tab o Makefiles are white-space sensitive! o Running make will execute the first rule in the current directory o make target will execute the rule to make the named target For more details man makeQuestion time 1. What happens if I use an index on an array that is larger than the number of elements in the array? 2. An array is declared using a. How many total elements does the array have? b. What would be the name of the tenth element in the array? 3. What must be the first line of a function definition, and what information does it contain?","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
