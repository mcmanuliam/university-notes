What is a function? A B C Students Grades D F Kathy Scott Sandeep Patel Carlota Rodriguez Jalen Williams Functions - Terminology Given a function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 • 𝐴 is called the domain of 𝑓. • 𝐵 is called the codomain of 𝑓. • If 𝑓(𝑎) = 𝑏, • then 𝑏 is called the image of 𝑎 under 𝑓. • 𝑎 is called the preimage of 𝑏. • The image (or range) of 𝑓, denoted by 𝑓(𝐴), is the collection of all images of f. That is: 𝑓 𝐴 = {𝑓 𝑎 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴} = {𝑏 ∈ 𝐵 ∃𝑎 s.t. 𝑓 𝑎 = 𝑏} • We may not be mapping to every element in 𝐵, so the codomain and range are not necessarily the same set. Representations of Functions • An explicit enumeration of the assignment ➢Table, list, etc. ➢Students-grades example • A formula ➢E.g.: 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑥 + 1 • A plot • A computer program ➢E.g.: A Python program that, given an integer 𝑛, produces the 𝑛-th Fibonacci Number Quick Quiz 𝑓(𝑎) = ?

Injective, Bijective, and Surjective Functions A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is called injective, or “one-to-one”, if it maps different elements of 𝐴 to different elements of 𝐵 That is, 𝑓 is injective if, for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝐴: 𝑥 ≠ 𝑦 ⟹ 𝑓 𝑥 ≠ 𝑓(𝑦) Equivalently: 𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑦 ⟹ 𝑥 = 𝑦 Injective Functions a b c d x y z w injective function A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is called surjective, or “onto”, if it “covers” entirely its codomain. That is, if 𝑓 𝐴 = 𝐵 Equivalently: for every 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵 there exists an 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 such that 𝑓 𝑎 = 𝑏 Surjective Functions a b c d y z w surjective function Quick Quiz – Injections/Surjections Let 𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑 , 𝐵 = 1,2,3 , and 𝑓 = {(𝑎, 3), (𝑏, 2), (𝑐, 1), (𝑑, 3)}. Is 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 injective or surjective? A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is called a bijection, or “on-to-one correspondence”, if it is both an injective and a surjective. Equivalently: every element of the codomain has a unique preimage Bijections a b c d x y z w bijective function Bijection: Example This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA Comparing Cardinalities • If 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 is injective, then |𝐴| ≤ |𝐵| • since each element of 𝐴 has a different image in 𝐵 • If 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 is surjective, then |𝐵| ≤ |𝐴| • since each element of 𝐵 has a preimage in 𝐴 • If 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 is bijection, then |𝐴| = |𝐵| • i.e. the sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 have exactly the same size Hmmm… • If you can show that there exists a bijection between two sets, you can prove they are of the same size • (Even if they are both “infinite”!) Inverse Functions Inverse Functions A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is invertible, if and only if it is a bijection. Then, its inverse function, denoted by 𝑓−1: 𝐵 → 𝐴, is the function defined by: 𝑓−1 𝑏 = 𝑎 ⟺ 𝑓 𝑎 = 𝑏 Notice: 𝑓−1(𝑓(𝑎)) = 𝑎 and 𝑓(𝑓−1(𝑏)) = 𝑏 for all 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵 Inverse Functions A B a b c d V W X Y 𝑓 A B a b c d V W X Y Composition of Functions • Definition: Let functions 𝑓: 𝐵 → 𝐶, 𝑔: 𝐴 → 𝐵. The composition of 𝑓 with 𝑔, is the function 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔: 𝐴 → 𝐶 defined by 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔 𝑎 = 𝑓(𝑔(𝑎)) Composition of Functions • Definition: Let functions 𝑓: 𝐵 → 𝐶, 𝑔: 𝐴 → 𝐵. The composition of 𝑓 with 𝑔, is the function 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔: 𝐴 → 𝐶 defined by 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔 𝑎 = 𝑓(𝑔(𝑎)) • Example: ▪ g(x) maps students to percentage marks ▪ f(x) maps percentage marks to letter grades ➢ so (𝑓 ∘ 𝑔)(𝑥) maps students to letter grades Composition A C a b c d i j h A B C a b c d V W X Y g h j i f Relations Binary Relations - Definition • Let 𝐴, 𝐵 be sets. A binary relation 𝑅 is a subset 𝑅 ⊆ 𝐴 × 𝐵. • If 𝑎, 𝑏 ∈ 𝑅 we say that “𝑎 is related to 𝑏 (by 𝑅)”. • Notation: 𝑎𝑅𝑏 Binary Relations - Example • Students: Alex, Bea, Cath, Don, Eddie, Fiona • Subjects: 1CSF, 1CSP, AF2 • Let 𝑅 be the relation of students who passed the subjects: 𝑅={(Alex,1CSF),(Alex,AF2),(Bea,AF2),(Cath,AF2),(Cath,1CSF), (Don,AF2),(Don,1CSF),(Fiona,1CSF),(Eddie,1CSF),(Fiona,1CSP)} Alex Bea Cath Don Eddie Fiona 1CSF AF2 1CSP Notice this is not a function e.g. Alex related to 1CSF and AF2 Relations are a generalization functions.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
