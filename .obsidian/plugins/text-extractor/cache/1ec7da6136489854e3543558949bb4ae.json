A) The physical limitations of an object B) The possible actions an object suggests C) A visual or auditory cue that communicates how to use an object D) The cultural norms that influence how an object is used 3 Design Theory Quiz Example User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 When introducing user-centered design (UCD) into an organization, which of the following challenges is often encountered? A. Struggling to integrate UCD with agile methodologies due to conflicting principles. B. Difficulty in standardizing design aesthetics across different platforms. C. Balancing the need for rapid product development with the time required for UCD iterations. D. Challenges in automating the UCD process to reduce manual effort. 4 UCD Quiz Example User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • Quiz: • Closed book • Multiple choice • 1 answer correct: +100% • Per incorrect answer: -33.3% • Moodle quiz • Quiz questions ask for basic understanding of concepts from lectures → see yesterday’s example questions • Exam • Open book → paper notes only • Exam questions tend not ask for definitions etc but instead put what we have learned into practice (apply/transfer) → See previous exam. 5 University policy.

(beyond Fitts) 37 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 A/B testing 38 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • Many names, same idea: A/B testing, web experiments, control/treatment, randomised experimental design, controlled experiment, split testing... • Randomly split traffic among different app versions • A/Control: usually current live version – B/Treatment: new idea • Collect metrics and analyse 39 A/B Testing undefined User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 “ However compelling the message, however great the copy, however strong the sales argument... the way a page is designed will have a dramatic impact on conversion rates, for better or for worse.” - http://www.alistapart.com/articles/designcancripple/ • Previous lectures have talked through design principles • But still hard to accurately predict if successful! • Often small features will have a surprisingly big effect! A/B Testing 40 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • Heading: Position and prominence • Columns: Number of columns used on the page • Visual Elements: competing for attention • Whitespace: on a page, space to ‘breathe’ • Photos: The age, sex and appearance of someone • Call to actions: position and colour • Testimonials: Position • Content type: text or as image • … Some design elements that can make a a significant difference in page performance 41 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • Add an item to your shopping cart at a website → Most sites show the cart • At Amazon, Greg Linden shows recommendations based on cart • Evaluation • Pro: cross-sell more items (increase average basket size) • Con: distracts people from checking out (reduces conversion) • HiPPO (Highest Paid Person’s Opinion) was: stop the project! • But: simple experiment, wildly successful, and the rest is history A/B at Amazon: Shopping Cart Recommendations For reference: R.

ACM KDD 2007 42 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 “We have an unprecedented opportunity to run A/B tests with online users and innovate more quickly based on actual user response. Microsoft needs to shift the culture from planning the exact features to planning a set of possible features and letting customers guide us.” – Ray Ozzie, Chief Software Architect at Microsoft A/B at Microsoft 43 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • “Find a house” widget variations • Overall Evaluation Criterion (OEC) : Revenue to Microsoft is generated every time a user clicks the search/find button • A or B? MSN Real Estate 44 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • A was 8.5% better • Since this is the #1 monetisation →effectively raised revenues • The actual experiment had six variants. → If you’re going to experiment, try more variants, especially if they’re easy to implement MSN Real Estate 45 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • OEC: Clicks on revenue-generating links (red below) • A or B? Office Online 46 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • B was 64% worse • Doesn’t tell us why one is more successful → Interviews, qualitative methods • Main point: it is hard to assess the value of ideas → Get the data by experimenting because data beats intuition Office Online 47 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • To detect an effect, you need to expose a certain number of users to the treatment (based on power calculations) • Fastest way to achieve that exposure → equal-probability variants – e.g., 50/50% for A/B • But: don’t start an experiment at 50/50% • That’s too much risk → Ramp up over a short period • Start an experiment at 0.1% of user base (or other small value) • Do simple analyses to make sure no egregious problems can be detected • Ramp up to a more significant percentage, and repeat until 50% Ramp-Up Approach 48 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • It tests for causal relationships, not just correlations → measure direct impact of change • It reduces the effect of external factors → e.g., history/seasonality impact A and B the same • Overcome poor intuition, especially with novel ideas • All too often, the less data, the stronger the opinions • So, get the data through experimentation Advantages of A/B testing 49 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • Organisation has to agree on OEC (Overall Evaluation Criterion) • This is hard, but it provides a clear direction and project alignment • Quantitative metrics may not explain why one is better or worse • No help for designers solve • No guidance for next design iteration Challenges with A/B testing 50 User Interaction | Lecture 11 | Joint Notes: https://shorter.me/rA292 • Primacy effect • cognitive bias where users tend to favor or remember the first piece of information, they encounter more than subsequent information • Changing the app or site may degrade the user experience (temporarily) even if the new design is better • Multiple experiments • Statistical variance increases → harder to get statistically significant results • Consistency and contamination • Assignment to A or B is usually cookie-based, but people may use multiple machines or erase cookies • Be careful to do proper randomisation!

(lowest meantime) • Which pointing device did not work so well? (high error rates) • Theories as to why you think one device worked better than the other. → Write the answer to these questions in your Teams space.
