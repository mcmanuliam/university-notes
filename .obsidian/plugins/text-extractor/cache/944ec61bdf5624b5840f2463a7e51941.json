Propositional Logic Logic • Logic is the basis of all mathematical reasoning • It is more fundamental than mathematics • The rules of logic give precise meaning to statements • Provides a methodology for objectively reasoning about the truth or falsity of such statements • It is the foundation for expressing formal proofs in all branches of mathematics and computing. Logic • Logic is studied, expressed and used under the umbrella of “logical systems” • You can think of them as “Paradigms” • All systems use a specific FIXED, FORMAL LANGUAGE • Two of the most widely studied are: • Propositional Logic (This topic) • First-Order Logic (also known as “Predicate Logic” – Next one) Propositional logic Propositional Logic is the: logic of compound statements built from simpler statements using Boolean connectives Some applications in computing science • design of digital electronic circuits • expressing conditions in programs • queries to databases and search engines Propositional logic Propositional Logic is the: logic of compound statements built from simpler statements using Boolean connectives Some applications in computing science • design of digital electronic circuits • expressing conditions in programs • queries to databases and search engines So: we’ve been using propositional logic already for a while now. We are now revisiting it and re- building it from the ground up, much more rigorously and formally, which will let us tackle more complex problems and advanced topics which build on top of this foundation.

Connectives Used to generate new mathematical statements by combining one or more propositions Generated statements are called compound propositions or formulae We use capital letters to denote such statements • typically use the letters P, Q, R, … We will use truth tables which display the relationship between the truth value of a formula and the truth values of the propositions (and subformulae) within it Connectives - Negation Examples: • let p be the proposition “today is Friday” • then ¬p is the proposition “it is not the case that today is Friday” or better “it is not Friday” • let q be the proposition “it is raining” • then ¬q is the proposition “it is not the case that it is raining” or better “it is not raining” Truth table for ¬p: p ¬p p ¬p or equivalently This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND Connectives - Negation Examples: • let p be the proposition “today is Friday” • then ¬p is the proposition “it is not the case that today is Friday” or better “it is not Friday” • let q be the proposition “it is raining” • then ¬q is the proposition “it is not the case that it is raining” or better “it is not raining” Truth table for ¬p: p ¬p false true true false p ¬p 0 1 1 0 or equivalently This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND Connectives – Conjunction (AND)Connectives – Conjunction (AND) Example: − let p be the proposition “today is Friday” − let q be the proposition “it is raining” − then p∧q (“p and q”) is the proposition “today is Friday and it is raining” Truth table p∧q: p q p∧q Note: in the first two columns count up in binary as we move down the rows Connectives – Conjunction (AND) Example: − let p be the proposition “today is Friday” − let q be the proposition “it is raining” − then p∧q (“p and q”) is the proposition “today is Friday and it is raining” Truth table p∧q: p q p∧q 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 Note: in the first two columns count up in binary as we move down the rows Connectives – Disjunction (OR) If you’re out shopping, you want to have: a card, OR cash, OR both Connectives – Disjunction (OR) Example: − let p be the proposition “I have cash” − let q be the proposition “I have credit card” − then p∨q (“p or q”) is the proposition “I have cash, or credir card (or both)” Truth table for p∨q: Note, this disjunction operation is: Either p, OR q, OR BOTH p q p∨q https://www.flickr.com/photos/68751915@N05/6280507539 Connectives – Disjunction (OR) Example: − let p be the proposition “I have cash” − let q be the proposition “I have credit card” − then p∨q (“p or q”) is the proposition “I have cash, or credir card (or both)” Truth table for p∨q: Note, this disjunction operation is: Either p, OR q, OR BOTH p q p∨q 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 Connectives – Disjunction (OR) Example: − let p be the proposition “I have access to network over WiFi” − let q be the proposition “I have access to network over Ethernet” − then p∨q (“p or q”) is the proposition “I have access to network over WiFI, or I have access to network over Ethernet, or both” Truth table for p∨q: Note, this disjunction operation is: Either p, OR q, OR BOTH p q p∨q 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-NC-ND Side note: Why we need humans in the loop This compound statement is logically correct: The charge on an electron is negative OR Waqar is an amphibious shape-shifting alien.

Computers work in binary (0 and 1’s) and all computation a computer performs (on a chip) reduces to the operations − negation or NOT gate − conjunction or AND gate − disjunction or OR gate − exclusive-or or XOR gate − and their inverted versions So any program you write in Java, C, Python… when compiled, it is reduced to these operations on bits… This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA Connectives – Implication https://www.flickr.com/photos/environmental_illness_network/8611065695 Connectives – Implication Example: − let p be the proposition “three incorrect pins entered” − let q be the proposition “account is frozen” − then p➝q (“p implies q”) is the proposition “if three incorrect pins entered, then account is frozen” Truth table for p➝q: p q p➝q think of p➝q as a contract Connectives – Implication Example: − let p be the proposition “three incorrect pins entered” − let q be the proposition “account is frozen” − then p➝q (“p implies q”) is the proposition “if three incorrect pins entered, then account is frozen” Truth table for p➝q: p q p➝q think of p➝q as a contract Vacuous: not expressing or showing intelligent thought or purpose Connectives – Implication All of the following are equivalent to p➝q − “p implies q” − “if p, then q” − “if p, q” − “q whenever p” − “p is sufficient for q” − “q is necessary for p” − … see Rosen for more discussion on this.. p q p➝q 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 think of p➝q as a contract Side note: Why we need humans in the loop The following implication is logically correct IF the charge on an electron is positive THEN Waqar is an amphibious shape-shifting alien. It is “vacuously” true; the first proposition – the condition – is always false, so whatever it implies, the implication stands true. Maybe easier to think of it this way: the implication is not false. The “contract” is not violated, even if the second proposition is impossible*). *one hopes Connectives – Implication; Example Think of p➝q as a contract − the contract holds, or it does not If it is sunny, then you will take me to the beach − p: it is sunny − q: you will take me to the beach p q p➝q what does this mean?

In other words, you could say that the “information content” of two logically equivalent statements is exactly the same. If you were to create truth table of two logically equivalent statements, it would be IDENTICAL. More on this later.

examples: p➝p (if p, then p) and p∨¬p (either p or not p) A contradiction is a formula that is always false − classic example: p∧¬p (p, and not p) If a formula is NEITHER a tautology, NOR a contradiction, then it is a CONTINGENCY − examples: p➝q, p∨q and p∧q Satisfiable Formulas • If there is at least one assignment of truth values to its variables that makes it true. − Tautologies are (obviously) satisfiable • they are ALWAYS true − Contingencies are satisfiable: • there will be some (at least) one case which makes it true • i.e. at least one row in the truth table will be true − Contradictions are NOT satisfiable • Never true Tautologies Contingencies Contradictions Satisfiable formulas LOGICAL EQUIVALENCE Outline Propositions Connectives Tautologies and contradictions Logical equivalence − introduction − laws of logical equivalence − examples Logical equivalence Two syntactically (i.e. textually) different compound propositions (formulae) may be semantically identical (i.e. have the same meaning) − it such cases they are called logically equivalent The statement P ≡ Q expresses that P is logically equivalent to Q − given any assignment to the propositions appearing in P and Q, the truth values of P and Q are the same ≡We have come across logical equivalence alreadyLogical equivalence To show two compound propositions are not logically equivalent − need to give one assignment to the propositions that makes one of the formulae true and the other formula false • notice do not need to give the full truth table, just one row is enough to show non-equivalence • Example: (p∨q)∧r ≢ p∨(q∧r) are not logically equivalent ≢Logical equivalence • Consider what is required to show non-equivalence − Just one “counter example” is enough. • This means, to prove equivalence, we must be able to show that the two formulaes have the same truth value for ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF INPUT PROPOSITIONS p ¬p ¬(¬p) Logical equivalence • Consider what is required to show non-equivalence − Just one “counter example” is enough. • This means, to prove equivalence, we must be able to show that the two formulaes have the same truth value for ALL POSSIBLE COMBINATIONS OF INPUT PROPOSITIONS • E.g.: p ≡ ¬(¬p) p ¬p ¬(¬p) 0 1 0 1 0 1 Logical Equivalence How can we PROVE equivalence Logical equivalence can be proved by: − by laws of logical equivalence (this sub-topic) − by a truth table (i.e. show truth table columns are the same) • number of rows of a truth table is 2n where n is number of propositions − by some other line of reasoning Outline Propositions Connectives Tautologies and contradictions Logical equivalence − introduction − laws of logical equivalence − examples Laws of logical equivalence These are similar to the arithmetic identities such as: − x⋅0 = 0 − x⋅1 = x − x + y = y + x − x⋅(y + z) = x⋅y + x⋅z − x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z The identities hold for all possible values of x, y and z In the world of propositional logic, instead of equality (=) we use logical equivalence (≡) , and apply it to compound proposition (formulae) − provides a pattern or template that can be used to match all or part of a much more complicated proposition and to find an equivalence for it • examples to come − can replace pattern on either side of the law with that on the other Laws – Identity & DominationLaws – Identity Identity
