When do they have the same structure? (That is, if we were to rename the vertices of one, it becomes the other) We need the concept of Isomorphism − e.g. there are isomorphisms between G1 and G2 and between G3 and G4 Isomorphic graphs 1 3 2 4 a cd b G2G1 G3 G4 G5 a cd b 1 43 2 a cd Isomorphic graphs Are two graphs G1 and G2 isomorphic − that is, could the vertices of G1 be renamed such that G1 becomes G2 Formally: Undirected graphs G1=(V1,E1) and G2=(V2,E2) are isomorphic if: − there is a bijection f from the vertex set V1 to the vertex set V2 − and: {v,w}∈E1 if and only if {f(v),f(w)}∈E2 • i.e. v and w are adjacent if and only if f(v) and f(w) are adjacent So far, best algorithm for checking two graphs are isomorphic is exponential, i.e O(2n), in the worst case. Are two graphs G1 and G2 isomorphic − that is, could the vertices of G1 be renamed such that G1 becomes G2 More formally: − is there a bijection f from the vertex set V1 to the vertex set V2 such that {v,w}∈E1 if and only if {f(v),f(w)}∈E2 Are these graphs isomorphic?

Graph Models: Computer Networks • Graphs used extensively for modelling applications a wide range of domains. • When we build a graph model, we use the appropriate type of graph to capture the important features of the application. • For example, computer networks can be modelled as graphs. − The vertices represent data centers and the edges represent communication links. • To model a computer network where we are only concerned whether two data centers are connected by a communications link, we use a simple graph. − This is the appropriate type of graph when we only care whether two data centers are directly linked (and not how many links there may be) and all communications links work in both directions. Graph Models: Social Networks • Graphs can be used to model social structures based on different kinds of relationships between people or groups. • In a social network, vertices represent individuals or organizations and edges represent relationships between them. • Useful graph models of social networks include: − friendship graphs - undirected graphs where two people are connected if they are friends (in the real world, on Facebook, or in a particular virtual world, and so on.) − collaboration graphs - undirected graphs where two people are connected if they collaborate in a specific way − influence graphs - directed graphs where there is an edge from one person to another if the first person can influence the second person Graph Models: Social Networks (continued) Example: A friendship graph where two people are connected if they are Facebook friends. Example: An influence graph Software Design Applications • Graph models are extensively used in software design. • When a top-down approach is used to design software, the system is divided into modules, each performing a specific task. • We use a module dependency graph to represent the dependency between these modules. These dependencies need to be understood before coding can be done. − In a module dependency graph vertices represent software modules and there is an edge from one module to another if the second module depends on the first. Example: The dependencies between the seven modules in the design of a web browser are represented by this module dependency graph.
