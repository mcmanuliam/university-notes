Last Years Feeback Class rep • ? Feedback • In April, you’ll be asked to complete standardised course evaluation questionnaires via the EvaSys system. • As before, please ignore these until the teaching is done • However, you can give me feedback on this course anytime –email me or catch me after class. • You should also come to Matthew Barr (as programme director) with any feedback or concerns about the GA programme as a whole. • You can also speak to your class rep… Topics Covered: User Interaction Topics 1.

Class Test HCI History and Introduction • HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) • Broad term • Lots of sub-fields • Highly interdisciplinary History of HCI Colossus (1940s) – Bletchley park code breaking Programming punch card, IBM Fortran UNIX Computer Command Line Interface History of HCI • HCI generally thought of as beginning in early 1980s • Although studies were done before this that in retrospect followed ‘HCI’ methods and principles • Conferences began • Influential textbooks • Emergence of the Graphical User Interface Emergence of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Emergence of Graphical User Interface (GUI) Xeros Star • Xero Start – 1981 • First GUI computer released • Bit-mapped display • WIMP, WYSIWYG • Desktop Metaphor • Yet not a commercial success • Very expensive; network terminal, not ‘personal’ computer Evolution of Computers Evolution of the Mac First in 1984 - Bring the GUI to a wider audience Broadening of HCI Topics • 1980s: early research often looking at efficiency • E.g. measure speed and accuracy • Lab-based studies • Formal experiments • 1990s: field started to broaden, alongside importance of internet • Emails, Web: topics related to communication • 2000s: Mobile/ portable computing • Real world studies ‘in the wild’ • New technologies: sensors, wearable, VR/AR • Study social, emotional, cultural issues • ”Older” forms of research, though, have not gone away Broadening Methods • Technology pushed progress here as well • Eye tracking studies, EEG • Large-scale studies, users' own devices • From early studies that times task/ counted errors • Brought in techniques more from sociology than psychology • Ethnography • Interviews • Case Studies HCI has progressed in three “Waves” • First Wave: Psychology and Perception • Second Wave: Organisational and Process Oriented • Third Wave: Social and Ubiquitous • Fourth Wave? For Reference: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1182476 Susanna Bødker “When second wave HCI meets third wave challenges” Reference: TED Talk on Future of HCI: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_ZzhadA3DY&t=605s The Things You See Around You Today Are Not There by Random Chance • The interfaces familiar with us may seem easy to design but are the result of many attempts and many failed designs.
