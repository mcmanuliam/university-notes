Conditional probabilitiesConditional probabilities For events A and B, if P[B]>0, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined by: P[A|B] Conditional probabilities For events A and B, if P[B]>0, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined by: P[A∩B] P[B] P[A|B] = Conditional probabilities For events A and B, if P[B]>0, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined by: Think of it this way: Given that you have been told that event B has already happened, THAT is now your Universe, and the size of set B (its cardinality) will now be in the denominator (rather than the size of the original Universe). For the numerator, you need to count the number of events of interest inside your new Universe. These are those elements of A (the event of interest) that are also in B (which is now the new Universe). That is, |A∩B|. So: P[A|B] = |A∩B| / |B|, or equivalently P[A|B] = P[A∩B] / P[B] P[A∩B] P[B] P[A|B] = Conditional probabilities For events A and B, if P[B]>0, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined by: − need P[B]>0 as otherwise we are dividing by zero P[A∩B] P[B] P[A|B] = Conditional probabilities For events A and B, if P[B]>0, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined by: − need P[B]>0 as otherwise we are dividing by zero If A and B are independent * then P[A|B] = P[A] P[A∩B] P[B] P[A|B] = *Independent events means the occurrence of one event has no impact on the other. That is the same as saying that the Probability of A is the same whether or not B occurs, i.e. P[A|B] = P[A]. E.g. given two dices, A is throwing first dice even, and B is throwing the second dice odd. One has no impact on the other. Note that this is entirely different what are called mutually exclusive events, where the occurrence of one precludes the occurrence of the other. E.g. A is throwing a dice even, and B is throwing a (the same) dice odd. Conditional probabilities: Example For events A and B, if P[B]>0, then the conditional probability of A given B is defined by: Example: given than that a dice throw is even, what is the probability that it is a 4?
