Dr. Graham McDonald Senior Lecturer Email: graham.mcdonald@glasgow.ac.uk • About Me: • PhD in Information Retrieval • Research interests: Responsible Information Retrieval Sensitive information identification and fair retrieval strategies Each year we make incremental updates to the course • Some changes are operational, but student feedback is an important input to this process • Please complete the EvaSys feedback at the end of the semester! This year’s main updates to the course: • Additional NoSQL examples • New section on vector databases for inexact queries You will have plenty of opportunities for feedback and questions • E.g. in lectures, labs, on coursework etc. • If you have a question, ask! 3 Updates to Course • Issues in data & information management • Data modelling and ER diagrams • Design & implementation of a (relational) database application • Sets, relations, and relational algebra • Querying a database • Transactions and views • Beyond relational databases: NoSQL • Beyond exact queries: vector databases 4 Topics Covered This course will mostly focus on issues relating to the design, implementation and querying of relational databases. However, we will also introduce concepts that go beyond the relational model. • Aim: To understand the ways in which data storage and retrieval (e.g. databases) contribute to the management of large amounts of data. • Objectives: • Understand the nature of applications built using programs clustered around databases and other large collections of data. • Understand the overall architecture of a database management system. • Understand the mathematics that are necessary to manage and query relational databases. • Be able to carry out all the operational tasks of setting up and using a relational database. • Understand methods of data storage and retrieval that go beyond the relational model. 5 Aims & ObjectivesCourse Structure • Class Structure: • 2nd hour will be delivered as live lectures. • 1st hour will be interactive sessions covering previous day’s lecture. • Assessment: • Written examination 60%, • Mid semester class tests 10%, • In-class quiz 5% and • Course work 25% 6 Day Date Schedule Mon 28/10 Tue 29/10 Wed 30/10 Thu 31/10 Coursework 1 Handout & Lab Fri 01/11 Mon 04/11 Tue 05/11 Coursework 1 Due Wed 06/11 Coursework 2 Handout + Lab Thu 07/11 Workplace Days Fri 08/11 Mon 11/11 Tue 12/11 Wed 13/11 Thu 14/11 Lab Fri 15/11 Course Work 2 Due Mon 18/11 Tue 19/11 Wed 20/11 Class Test Thu 21/11 Workplace Days Fri 22/11 Moodle • Data Storage and Retrieval course page • https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=44988 • Lecture notes • Assessed coursework • Additional reading material • News forum • Moodle GA General Information • https://moodle.gla.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=45978 7 A recommended textbook Database systems : the complete book.

Issues in Data Management 11 Why are Databases Important? https://www.digitaltrends.com/cool-tech/dna- data-catalog-startup/ • Databases are a key technology • Used in a wide variety of applications to manage data • Growing in importance – amount of data we store is increasing • Consider the management of all of Facebook's user accounts and data…….. • This is a lot of data and a lot of data management involved! 12 Why are Databases Important?Understanding Databases • On this course you will design, build, populate and query your own database using MySQL • It is important you understand the theory, as well as how to use MySQL, so that you will easily be able to design, build and use other database applications in the future 13 Data, Information and Knowledge data 52 information J Smith’s score on the final exam is 52% knowledge I’ve passed! data 52 information J Smith’s score on the final exam is 52% knowledge I’ve passed! structured representation (encoding) data + meaning true belief Data, Information and Knowledge • Consider the example of handling the billing & monitoring of all UK household telephone calls • What kinds of data would you have to store? 16 Issues in Managing DataIssues in Managing Data • Consider the example of handling the billing & monitoring of all UK household telephone calls • What kinds of data would you have to store? ➢ People’s names ➢ Addresses ➢ Phone numbers ➢ Post codes ➢ Account Codes ➢ Bank details ➢ Money owed ➢ …………. 17 • Consider the example of handling the billing & monitoring of all UK household telephone calls • Can you think of any issues associated with managing all this data and the tasks associated with it? ➢ On paper? ➢ In filing cabinets? ➢ In spreadsheets or text documents? 18 Issues in Managing Data • What about managing all of Amazon’s data? • 20 million products available • Need to hold terabytes of data • 310 million users, with thousands of users active at the same time • Processing distributed around the world • Need access to data for monitoring and looking for significant patterns • Reliability and security important ➢ E.g. required by EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) 19 Issues in Managing DataManaging Data • If we have lots of data to store, we need a really good way to store that data • We also need good ways to be able to access that data quickly and easily • And we don’t want lots of different versions of the data all over the place - we want to avoid REDUNDANCY 20 • Our data storage tool must provide these features: • Data definition (data structuring) • Data entry (to add new data) • Data editing (to change existing data) • Querying (a means of extracting data by a description) • Persistence (data existing beyond a single operation or program invocation) 21 Data StorageStrategies for Data Management 1 • A program where all the data is held in the program’s memory • But no data persistence between invocations of a program • The data is reconstructed (or re-entered) at each invocation of the program 22 Strategies for Data Management 2 • Files of data on disk that can be accessed by different applications • Each application is responsible for its own representations of the data • Difficult to coordinate between applications • Might be different versions of the data 23 Strategies for Data Management 3 • Combine together all the functions of data storage and access for a related set of tasks, e.g. • handling student records • stock control in a warehouse • account management in a bank • This is known as a Database Management System (DBMS) 24 What is a database? • A database (abbreviated DB) is an entity in which related data can be stored in a structured manner, with as little redundancy as possible • A database gives users access to data, which they can view, enter, or update • within the limits of the access rights granted to them • It is viewable (and writable) by many users at the same time - controlled concurrent access 26 What is a database? • Hierarchic databases (older) • Network databases (older) • Relational databases (very common) • Object Oriented Databases (1990s) • NoSQL Databases (2000s) 27 MongoDB, HBase MySQL, Postgres, Oracle, MS SQLServer Informix, Greenplum Our focus Types of DatabaseA Relational Database… • A relational database can be thought of as a series of tables about related information • For example, Amazon’s database might have a table called Products: • As well as related tables called Customers, Suppliers, Orders, Reviews, etc: 28 Product ID Product Title Description ISBN Supplier # 194729187 Database Systems: The Complete Book For Database Systems and Database Design and Application courses ... 129202447X 2847 5 … Supplier ID Address … 2847 14 Cider St Customer ID Email Address … … Operations on a Database • What operations can be done upon a database? • Views: read existing data • Manipulation: Amend existing data, or add new data • All this may occur concurrently, by many different users with varying permissions 29 Supplier ID Address … 2847 14 Cider St Customer ID Email Address … … Product ID Product Title Description ISBN Supplier # 194729187 Database Systems: The Complete Book For Database Systems and Database Design and Application courses ... 129202447X 2847 5 … • Ambiguity • Same thing with different name in different files • Inconsistency • If data changes in one place it should also change in the other files is exists in 30 Databases Avoid RedundancyAn Example Database • Example table from a geographical database • Boss says: “I want the county population details too, including Essex!” 31 town county population County town? Cathedral? Welwyn Garden Hertfordshire 40,570 no no St. Albans Hertfordshire 123,800 no yes Hertford Hertfordshire 2,023 yes no Durham Durham 29,490 yes yes • Add county details, including Essex: • Redundant information can become inconsistent: • Consider update “population for Hertfordshire has gone up to 1.04M” town county population County town? Cathedral? County population County size Welwyn Garden Hertfordshire 40,570 no no 937,300 631 St. Albans Hertfordshire 123,800 no yes 937,300 631 Hertford Hertfordshire 2,023 yes no 937,300 631 Durham Durham 29,490 yes yes 132,681 295 Essex 1,464,200 1,528 Extended Database (badly designed) 32 Redundancy: Information about Hertfordshire is duplicated: difficult to update without inconsistency We have information about the population of Essex as a whole but none about any individual town. • Ambiguity • Same thing with different name in different files • Inconsistency • If data changes in one place it should also change in the other files is exists in • Wasted effort • Data should be shared where possible to save time and effort billing accounts customers Phone line Technical team Billing team all 33 Databases Avoid RedundancyDatabases Avoid Redundancy (2) • Having data repeated in different places indicates poor relational database design • The data relationships, inherent in a relational database, should allow you to: • maintain a single data field, at one location. • Such that the database’s relational model is then responsible for porting any changes, to that data field, across the database. • E.g. a single table with Town & County-level details is a poor design 34 Controlled Concurrent Access • Databases can have many users reading and writing at the same time • We need to make sure that each view of the data is correct or consistent for each user • So that concurrent access does not cause incorrect updates • Lets see an example… 35 Bank Account • Imagine a bank’s database of accounts • And the operation to withdraw £10 from a cash machine: X = Get_balance(); Set_balance(X-10); • Now what happens if Mr & Mrs Bloggs both withdraw £10 concurrently, i.e. at exactly the same time? 36 Customer Balance (£) Mr & Mrs Bloggs 100 … … Bank Account X = Get_balance(); Set_balance(X-10);  Here, concurrent access resulted in an incorrect account balance being recorded 37 X=100 X = Get_balance(); Set_balance(X-10); X=100 Customer Balance (£) Mr & Mrs Bloggs 100 … … 90 Mr Bloggs Mrs Bloggs Controlled Concurrent Access • Databases can have many users reading and writing at the same time • We need to make sure that each view of the data is correct or consistent for each user • So that concurrent access does not cause incorrect updates • DBMS have concurrent control software to ensure that several users updating the same data do so in a controlled manner • This happens through transactions, which make concurrent database interactions appear to happen independently & sequentially 38 Database Management Systems 39 A DBMS is the software that can provide features needed by many databases: 1. Sharing and integration of data 2. Multiple views of the same data 3. Controlled concurrent access 4. Management of security and integrity More on DBMS attributes in next lecture!","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
