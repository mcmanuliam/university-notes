E.g.: − All men are mortal − Socrates is a man − All GA students take PA − Someone took that last cupcake I had my eye on • Premises are used as the basis of logical reasoning: − e.g., contructing valid arguments With Apologies to The Socrates Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are mortal.” − “My pet cat is a mortal.” • And the conclusion: − “My pet cat is a man.” • Huh?!

With Apologies to The Socrates Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are mortal.” − “Socrates is a mortal.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is a man.” With Apologies to The Socrates Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are mortal.” − “Socrates is a mortal.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is a man.” Invalid argument! The Socrates ARGUMENT Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are mortal.” − “Socrates is a man.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is mortal.” The Socrates ARGUMENT Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are mortal.” − “Socrates is a man.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is mortal.” Valid argument! The Socrates ARGUMENT Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are mortal.” − “Socrates is a man.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is mortal.” • This conclusion is correct? (Yes it is) • How do we ensure our conclusions are correct given certain premises − That is: how do we construct valid arguments • Are there are other such “valid” forms of arguments? • Can we build more complex arguments from simpler arguments? • How does this apply to CS and SE? Valid argument! The Socrates ARGUMENT Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are from Mars.” − “Socrates is a man.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is from Mars.” The Socrates ARGUMENT Example • Say we have the two premises: − “All men are from Mars.” − “Socrates is a man.” • And the conclusion: − “Socrates is from Mars.” Valid argument! Achtung!* • We are only looking at the structure of valid arguments. − That is, going from premises (propositions assumed to be true) to − a conclusion that logically follows from the premises. • We are not concerned (here at least) about the “factful-ness” of our conclusions. − Our premises may “in actual fact” be false, but if we use valid forms of argument, then the conclusions are also valid • the conclusions may “in actual fact” be false, we don’t care − Similarly: We arrive at a conclusion that is “in actual fact” true, but if the argument we used to arrive at that conclusion was invalid, so is the conclusion! * Meaning of Achtung https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Achtung%21 ** Why I know this word: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRpTtNLM6pk&list=PLv8ZCmeG525b0jnqIinTk2m33pMJpfJLa This Topic... • We will look at what arguments are, and how to construct valid arguments • Once we know how to build correct arguments, we will learn how to create: proofs for theorems What kind of theorems do want to prove in Computing Science? − program verification (correctness, termination, invariance, liveness) − security (operating systems, file systems) − software specification (consistent, quality of service, functional behaviour) − types are correct in a program (type checking) − ...

Inference rules for Propositional Logic 2. Inference rules for Predicate Logic • Inference rules for propositional logic plus additional inference rules to handle variables and quantifiers. Arguments in Propositional Logic • A argument in propositional logic is a sequence of propositions. − All but the final proposition are called premises. − The last statement is the conclusion. • The argument is valid if the premises imply the conclusion. • An argument form is an argument that is valid no matter what propositions are substituted into its propositional variables. • Given that an argument form is valid; then if the premises are p1 ,p2, …,pn and the conclusion is q then (p1 ∧ p2 ∧ … ∧ pn ) → q is (i.e. should be) a tautology. • Inference rules are all simple argument forms that will be used to construct more complex argument forms.

Existential Instantiation (EI) Existential Instantiation (EI) Example: “There is someone who got an A in the course.” “Let’s call her a and say that a got an A” Existential Generalization (EG) Existential Generalization (EG) Example: “Michelle got an A in the class.” “Therefore, someone got an A in the class.” Rules of Inference for Quantified Statements: SummaryUsing Rules of Inference Example 1: Using the rules of inference, construct a valid argument to show that “Jean has a GUID” is a consequence of the premises: “Everyone who is a student of GU has a GUID” “Jean is a student of GU.” Using Rules of Inference Example 1: Using the rules of inference, construct a valid argument to show that “Jean has a GUID” is a consequence of the premises: “Everyone who is a student of GU has a GUID” “Jean is a student of GU.” Solution: Let S(x) denote “x is a student of GU” and ID(x) denote “x has a GUID” and Jean be a member of the domain of discourse U = students of GU Valid Argument: ? Using Rules of Inference Example 1: Using the rules of inference, construct a valid argument to show that “Jean has a GUID” is a consequence of the premises: “Everyone who is a student of GU has a GUID” “Jean is a student of GU.” Solution: Let S(x) denote “x is a student of GU” and ID(x) denote “x has a GUID” and Jean be a member of the domain of discourse U = students of GU Valid Argument: 1. ∀𝑥 (𝑆 𝑥 → 𝐼𝐷 𝑥 Premise; Everyone who is a student of GU has a GUID 2. 𝑆 𝐽 → 𝐼𝐷 𝐽 UI from (1); If Jean is a student of GU, then she has a GUID 3. 𝑆 𝐽 Premise; Jean is a student of GU 4. 𝐼𝐷 𝐽 Modes Ponens using 2 and 3: Jean has a GUID Using Rules of Inference – on your own Example 2: Use the rules of inference to construct a valid argument showing that the conclusion “Someone who passed the first exam has not read the book.” follows from the premises “A student in this class has not read the book.” “Everyone in this class passed the first exam.” Solution: Let C(x) denote “x is in this class,” B(x) denote “ x has read the book,” and P(x) denote “x passed the first exam.” First we translate the premises and conclusion into symbolic form.
