Climbing an Infinite Ladder Can we reach ANY step in this infinite ladder? Suppose we have an infinite ladder, and we can show: 1. We can reach the first rung of the ladder. 2. If we can reach a particular rung of the ladder, then we can reach the next rung. * or, equivalently, any arbitrary rung of the ladder Suppose we have an infinite ladder, and we can show: 1. We can reach the first rung of the ladder. 2. If we can reach a particular rung of the ladder, then we can reach the next rung. From (1), we can reach the first rung. Then by applying (2), we can reach the second rung. Applying (2) again, the third rung. And so on. We can apply (2) any number of times to reach any particular rung, no matter how high up. This example motivates proof by mathematical induction. Climbing an Infinite Ladder Can we reach ANY step in this infinite ladder?Principle of Mathematical Induction To prove that 𝑃(𝑛) is true for all positive integers 𝑛, we complete these steps: • Basis Step: Show that 𝑃(1) is true. • Inductive Step: • First assume: 𝑃(𝑘) is true for an arbitrary 𝑘 (inductive hypothesis) • Then show: If 𝑃(𝑘) is true, then 𝑃(𝑘 + 1) is true for all positive integers 𝑘. • That is, show: 𝑃(𝑘) → 𝑃(𝑘 + 1) ∀ 𝑘. • (Using the if-then, or implication symbol “→”, and for all operator \"∀\") Where “P” is a what is called a proposition. A proposition is a statement that must have a truth value; that is, it must be either true or false. P(n) is that proposition with a variable that has been set to the value “n”. Another view of how Mathematical Induction Works Consider an infinite sequence of dominoes, labeled 1,2,3, …, where each domino is standing. We know that the first domino is knocked down, i.e., P(1) is true . We also know that if whenever the kth domino is knocked over, it knocks over the (k + 1)st domino, i.e, P(k) → P(k + 1) is true for all positive integers k. Let P(n) be the proposition that the nth domino is knocked over. Hence, all dominos are knocked over. P(n) is true for all positive integers n.

It is not a tool for discovering such conjectures.
