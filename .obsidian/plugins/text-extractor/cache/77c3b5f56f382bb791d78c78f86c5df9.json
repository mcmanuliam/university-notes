Visual Usability • Multidisciplinary challenges • Graphic design alone doesn’t help teach us how to create complex interactive systems • Usability alone might not teach us how to create the best experiences • A complex interface might need to covey many messages • Should provide order, patterns to help people process information and derive meaning • Visual usability • Designs grounded in principles of aesthetics and understanding of people • We should be able to design and defend a design based on heuristics and best practices Consistency • Establishing consistency means setting and maintaining expectations • External Consistency • Consistency with other similar applications • If you are designing an interface for online shopping, it should be like the established look/fell of existing interfaces • Internal Consistency • Consistency within different parts of an application • If you are designing an interface for online banking, all the views need consistency • Internal/ external can sometimes clash • E.g., suite of apps from the same company: Should they primarily look and feel like each other, or should each one meet the conventions of that type of app? Types of Consistency • Layout Consistency • Screens showing similar information should have all elements positions the same way • Spatial relationships should remain consistent • Typography Consistency • Use fonts, weights, and sizes meaningfully and consistently • Color Consistency • Use color to establish and maintain consistency – typically means establishing a defined color scheme • Imagery Consistency • Charts, logos, videos, photography, icons, backgrounds, and anything else that is not typography Breaking Consistency • Can break the rules to make a point/highlight something • E.g. make one piece of content bigger than others if it’s the most important/where you want to guide the eye • Do not change more than two aspects of a single item Hierarchy • Visual hierarchy is used to communicate structure, relationships and relative importance • More important items need more “visual weight” • Understanding behavior of gaze is important when deciding how to effectively give important elements more visual weight • Use position, size, color, groupings, contrast, control types to represent priorities • Make sure people notice what they need too – based on identified user proprieties • Start with black and white wireframes – only vary size and position Layout • Screen size • The screen gives the frame within which your entire interface sits • Core layout principles might apple to all screen sizes 0 main thing is how elements related to each other, so layout can flex • Position • Does the relative position of elements communicate structure • Might need to balance lots of relationships • White Space • Absence of content (not necessarily ‘white’!) is equally important, for example the sparse design on a Google landing page • Trick to create dense but appealing screens is white space to group and establish hierarchy • Grid • Align items relative to (invisible) horizontal and vertical lines Proximity, Scale and Alignment • Proximity • Is the relative placement of items arbitrary or meaningful? • Scale • Is the relative size of elements arbitrary or meaningful? • Alignment • Is the alignment consistent and used to represent the hierarchy? Colour • Powerful way of attracting the eye • Can create emotional responses • Enhance usability and appeal • Aid understanding by creating connections between related items • Colour choices • Can be cultural associations • Specific UI conventions • E.g., Red for error messages. But maybe only if critical • Should not covey anything crucial through colour alone • Visually impaired/ colour blind users Colour CircleTest and Iterate Heuristics Lecture 2 Visibility of system status • The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time. • “Micro interactions” • Think about: • feedback of continuous internal state • progress through a task, or • discrete actions Visibility of System Status • Will the user feel confident their input was detected? Match between system and the real world • The system should speak the users’ language. • Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. • Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order. • Skeuomorphism? Match between system and the real worldUser control and freedom • Users often perform actions by mistake. • They need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process. • Support undo and redo. Maintain Consistency and Adhere to Standards • Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. • Follow platform (internal) and industry (external) conventions. Maintain Consistency and Adhere to Standards Error prevention • Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. • Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action. Recognition rather than recall • Minimize the user’s memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. • The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. • Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed. Flexibility and efficiency of use • Shortcuts – hidden from novice users – may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. • Allow users to tailor frequent actions. Aesthetic and minimalist design • Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant or rarely needed. • Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility. Aesthetic and minimalist designHelp users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors • Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution. • These error messages should also be presented with visual treatments that will help users notice and recognize them. Help and documentation • It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. • However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.
