On my machine: 24 bytes (* 8 = 192 bits) o Q: How many instructions does Python execute to compute x+1? § (even more tricky) § A: I don’t know, but many more than just the addition ... Python is dynamically typed, so the data type of x could change at any time. Every operation tests the data types of the operands to check which instruction to execute. A lot of uncertainty and lack of control 🙁 A simple C program o Q: What value does x have at the end of the program execution? § (not a tricky question) § A: 42 o Q: How much memory does C take to store x? § (not that tricky) § A: sizeof(int) usually 4 bytes (* 8 = 32 bits) o Q: How many instructions does C take to compute x+1? § (not that tricky) § A: 1 add instruction and 2 memory (mov) instructions § Note: a useful tool for this is https://godbolt.org/ Certainty allows strong reasoning about the program’s performance and execution behaviour Efficiency and Reliability Why C? o Versatile § whole OS, compilers, networking, games, word processors, web apps, … o Portable (thanks to ANSI/ISO standards) § can be compiled and run on different platforms with no modification o Systems with constrained resources o Small number of keywords (32) o Modular § code reuse through functions and structures o Builds understanding of resource management § important for becoming a better developer Development Cycle • Applies to all compiled languages Development Cycle o A compiler error indicates that it is not possible to compile your program § You must change your program to get it compiling o A compiler warning indicates an unusual condition that may (and quite often does) indicate a problem § Do not ignore warnings § You should change the program to: either fix the problem or clarify the code to avoid the warning Compilers o You understand your C code (I hope!) o Your computer does not; it only understands machine language o A compiler translates from source code to object code o There are many C compilers, around 50 or so § Borland Turbo C (1987) § GNU Compiler Collection, GCC (1987) § Tiny C (2005) § Clang (2007) Compiling o To compile and then execute a C program: o Translating source code into machine code is a multi-step process: 1. The preprocessor expands macros 2. In the compiling stage, the source code is a) parsed and turned into an intermediate representation b) machine-specific assembly code is generated c) machine code is generated in an object file 3. The linker combines multiple object files into an executable o We will peek into each of these with examples 1. Preprocessing2a. Compiler intermediate representation2b. Assembly code2c. Machine code3. Linking o The linker combines one or more object files into a single executable o The linker checks that all functions called in the program have machine code available § e.g. printf’s machine code is in the C standard library o If the machine code for a function cannot be found, the linker complains § e.g. The compiler is your friend o Errors and warnings indicate that there is something wrong o As you mature as a developer, you will wish that your compiler throws more errors rather than get runtime ones! Shell Detour o Basic file exploring § ls, pwd, mkdir, cd, cat, head, tail, cp, mv, rm, touch o Editing text files o man The main() Function o The only one required for any C program o It denotes the entry point to the program § there can only be one and exactly one o It returns an int to signify the exit code § 0 = normal execution and termination, i.e. at last statement in main § Non Zero Exit Code = abnormal termination § if no return statement, an implicit return 0 is executed Basic output with printf o Defined in stdio.h, it allows the formatted printing of values o The first argument is the format string (using special characters) o The second argument onwards are the values to be printed o The number and order of format strings and values have to match Special Characters Explanation Argument Type %c Single character char %s Character string String: (char *) %d signed integer in decimal representation int %l or %ld or %li Long long %f floating-point number in decimal representation float double Full list at: https://en.cppreference.com/w/c/io/fprintf Common questions at this point o But… I want to use an IDE § Feel free to, but we will not support you as this is not an aim of the course § There are real benefits in developing code through command line tools • Understand the compile, link, execute process • Sometimes the only way to develop, e.g. for small devices or headless servers § Can cause other issues (e.g. huge cache files) that we cannot help with o How can I install clang on [platform]? § Guide for common platforms in the labsheet § Follow instructions relevant to your platform at https://clang.llvm.org/get_started.html","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
