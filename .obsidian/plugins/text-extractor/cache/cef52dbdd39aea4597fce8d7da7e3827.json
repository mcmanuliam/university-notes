Most obvious version is the ||x||2 (Eu- clidean norm), which is basically Pythagorus’s Theorem in n dimensions i.e. ||x||2 = √(x2 1 + x2 2 + x2 3 + ... + x2 n) 4 Sigma - Σ Σ – This Greek letter is called Sigma and represents a summation function Σx is equivalent to np.sum(x) where x is some array/list of numbers Σ can be accompanied by limits for some element of what is being summed Σ5 i=0x – sum x(i) (x is a function of i) for all values of i from 0 to 5 inclusive 1 5 Trigonometric functions sin, cos, tan – basic trigonometric functions (hopefully familiar from school). You may be used to using these with angles in degrees but we’d more usually use radians where 2π radians = 360 ◦ 2","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
