Silberschatz, “Operating System Concepts”, 9th Ed., 2012. CPU bound? IO bound? Systems Programming Recap: Process Control Block (PCB) • Information associated with each process • Also known as Process Table Entry 5Systems Programming Process Creation • Parent process creates child processes • A “process tree” captures parent-child relations • fork(2), exec(3), wait(2) • Execution options • Parent and children execute concurrently • Parent waits for children to terminate 6Systems Programming Fork, Exec, and Wait on a Unix-alike System in C 7 #include <sys/types.h> #include <stdio.h> #include <unistd.h> int main() { pid t pid; /* fork a child process */ pid = fork(); if (pid < 0) { /* error occurred */ fprintf(stderr, \"Fork Failed\"); return 1; } else if (pid == 0) { /* child process */ execlp(\"/bin/ls\", \"ls\", NULL); } else { /* parent process */ /* parent will wait for the child to complete */ wait(NULL); printf(\"Child Complete\"); } return 0; } Systems Programming Example: Linux Process Tree 8 init pid = 1 sshd pid = 3028 login pid = 8415 kthreadd pid = 2 sshd pid = 3610 pdflush pid = 200 khelper pid = 6 tcsch pid = 4005 emacs pid = 9204 bash pid = 8416 ps pid = 9298 Systems Programming Lecture Outline • The Life of a Process • Recap on Scheduling • To Try at Home (and OS(H)) Systems Programming Recap: Process Scheduling 10 • (CPU-)Scheduling’s main goal: Maximize CPU utilization • Several queues of processes need to be maintained: • Job queue (all processes in the system) • Ready queue (processes in memory and ready to execute) • Device queues (processes waiting on some device; one such queue per device) • Processes can migrate among the various queues Systems Programming Queue-Based Process Scheduling 11 Grey boxes: actions/queues Blue circles: queue servers Systems Programming Recap: CPU Scheduler 12 • CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process: 1. Switches from running to waiting state (e.g., IO request, sleep, etc.) 2. Switches from running to ready state (e.g., interrupt occurs) 3. Switches from waiting to ready (e.g., completion of IO) 4. Terminates • Non-preemptive scheduling: Let the process give up (yield) the CPU (Cases 1 and 4) • Preemptive scheduling: The Scheduler decides when a process yields the CPU (all cases) Systems Programming Dispatcher 13 • Gives control of the CPU to the process selected • Needs to: • Switch context (load registers, PCB, etc.) • Switch to user mode • Jump to the proper instruction in the user program to continue execution • Latency? • Note: context switch is pure overhead! Systems Programming Recap: CPU Schedulers 14 • First-Come, First-Served (FCFS or FIFO) • Priority based (preemptive and non-preemptive) • Shortest Job First (SJF) • Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF) • Round-Robin (RR) Covered in CANS and OS(H)! ☺ Systems Programming Lecture Outline • The Life of a Process • Recap on Scheduling • To Try at Home (and OS(H)) Systems Programming To Try at Home! • Investigate which tools allow you to see running processes on your OS • Which process is using the most memory and which the most CPU? Disk I/O? Network? • How many threads does a specific process have? Which user started a process? Which process has been running for the longest time? • How can you find a specific process? • Can you stop/kill a specific process while it runs? • Note: Please only try this, if you know it’s fine to stop a particular process Systems Programming More Also in OS(H) 17 → COMPSCI4011 Operating Systems (H) • School: School of Computing Science • Credits: 10 • Level: Level 4 (SCQF level 10) • Typically Offered: Semester 2 • https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI 4011 Systems Programming Recommended Reading 18 • Silberschatz, Galvin, Gagne, Operating Systems Concepts, Sections 3.1-3, 4.1, and 6.1-3","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
