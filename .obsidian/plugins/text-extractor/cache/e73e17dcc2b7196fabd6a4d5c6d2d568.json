Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head • Be careful about “corner cases”; e.g. what if list is empty? − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Deallocation is performed by the garbage collector in Python • Complexity O(1) DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 3 2 Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Complexity O(1) • Example − Delete (at the head) three times on the list below: DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 3 2 Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Complexity O(1) • Example − Delete (at the head) three times on the list below: DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 3 2 1) L.head is updated Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Complexity O(1) • Example − Delete (at the head) three times on the list below: DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 2 1) 3 is garbage collected Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Complexity O(1) • Example − Delete three times on the list below: DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 2 2) L.head is updated Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Complexity O(1) • Example − Delete three times on the list below: DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 3) 2 is garbage collected Deletion • Deletion at the head − Update L.head − Deallocate memory of node being deleted • Complexity O(1) • Example − Delete three times on the list below: DELETE-HEAD(L) if L.head != NIL L.head := L.head.next L.head 3) L.head = NIL Search This Photo by Unknown Author is licensed under CC BY-SA Search • Given value k, find the first element with key k in list L by a simple linear search − If such an object exists, return a pointer to it − If not, then return NIL • Example − Find k=3 in the list below: L.head 1 3 3 5 Can you perform the operations needed for searching?

To implement FIFO data structures, like queues: ➢ Insert (write) at one end, delete (read) at the other Insertion at the tail • We saw that insertion at the head is O(1) • What about insertion at the tail? • Example − Insert “6” at the tail of the following linked list L.head 1 3 3 5 Can you perform the operations needed for Insertion at tail? Complexity? 6 Insertion at the tail • We saw that insertion at the head is O(1) • Insertion at the tail requires to scan the entire list ➢ Complexity O(n) INSERT-TAIL(L,x) if L.head = NIL INSERT(L,x) else i := L.head while i.next != NIL i := i.next x.next := NIL i.next := x next 6 L.head 1 3 3 5 x Insertion at the tail • We saw that insertion at the head is O(1) • Insertion at the tail requires to scan the entire list ➢ Complexity O(n) • This is a significant drawback of using linked lists to implement queues INSERT-TAIL(L,x) if L.head = NIL INSERT(L,x) else i := L.head while i.next != NIL i := i.next x.next := NIL i.next := x next 6 L.head 1 3 3 5 x Insert at head vs insert at tail • Insert at head: O(1) • Insert at tail: O(n) Is there a way to make both operations run at O(1)? (We don’t mind incurring a small cost in space complexity…) Tail pointer • We extend the definition of a (singly) linked list L to include an attribute L.tail pointing to its last element • Empty lists: L.head = L.tail = NIL • INSERT and DELETE have to be adapted accordingly to update L.tail when needed L.head L.head 1 3 3 5 L.tail L.tail Insertion at the tail, with tail pointer • Can be performed in O(1) time • Example − Insert “6” at the tail of the list below L.head 1 3 3 5 L.tail 6x: INSERT-TAIL(L,x) x.next := NIL if L.tail = NIL L.head := x else L.tail.next := x L.tail := x Insertion at the tail, with tail pointer • Can be performed in O(1) time • Example − Insert “6” at the tail of the list below − Update x.next L.head 1 3 3 5 L.tail 6x: INSERT-TAIL(L,x) x.next := NIL if L.tail = NIL L.head := x else L.tail.next := x L.tail := x Insertion at the tail with tail pointer • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Insert “6” at the tail of the list below − Update L.tail.next L.head 1 3 3 5 L.tail 6x: INSERT-TAIL(L,x) x.next := NIL if L.tail = NIL L.head := x else L.tail.next := x L.tail := x Insertion at the tail with tail pointer • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Insert x.key = 6 at the tail of the list below − Update L.tail L.head 1 3 3 5 L.tail 6x: INSERT-TAIL(L,x) x.next := NIL if L.tail = NIL L.head := x else L.tail.next := x L.tail := x Insertion at the tail with tail pointer • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Insert x.key = 6 at the tail of the list below − Termination L.head 1 3 3 5 L.tail INSERT-TAIL(L,x) x.next := NIL if L.tail = NIL L.head := x else L.tail.next := x L.tail := x 6 x Deletion with tail pointer • Remove an element x from a linked list L • What steps will you follow to delete node x from the list below? L.head 1 4 3 5 x L.tail Deletion with tail pointer • Remove an element x from a linked list L − Note: pointer to node x must be retrieved first (for instance by calling SEARCH for a given key value) − Assume that we have such a pointer • We also need a pointer i to the predecessor of x in order to update i.next := x.next − Scan the list again and return i when i.next = x ➢ O(n) complexity L.head 1 4 3 5 x L.tail i Singly linked lists: main disadvantage List can only be traversed in one fixed direction (head → tail) How can we overcome this? DOUBLY LINKED LISTS Doubly linked lists • Extend definition of singly linked lists so that each node has an additional pointer attribute prev − Given a node x, x.prev points to the previous node in the list − If x.prev = NIL, x has no predecessor and is therefore the head of the list • Pros: key operations are simpler to implement and more efficiennt • Cons: memory overhead → O(n) for maintaining the prev pointers nextkey NIL x L.head 1 4 3 5 NIL prev Deletion in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time ➢ We don’t need to traverse the list anymore! • Example − Delete x from the list below - Important: Think about corner cases (x might be the head/tail element) L.head 1 4 3 5 x Deletion in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Delete x from the list below DELETE(L,x) if x.prev != NIL x.prev.next := x.next else L.head:= x.next if x.next != NIL x.next.prev := x.prev L.head 1 4 3 5 x Deletion in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Delete x from the list below − Update x.prev.next DELETE(L,x) if x.prev != NIL x.prev.next := x.next else L.head:= x.next if x.next != NIL x.next.prev := x.prev L.head 1 4 3 5 x Deletion of an element in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Delete x from the list below − Update x.prev.next DELETE(L,x) if x.prev != NIL x.prev.next := x.next else L.head:= x.next if x.next != NIL x.next.prev := x.prev L.head 1 4 3 5 x Deletion of an element in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Delete x from the list below − Update x.next.prev DELETE(L,x) if x.prev != NIL x.prev.next := x.next else L.head:= x.next if x.next != NIL x.next.prev := x.prev L.head 1 4 3 5 x Deletion of an element in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Delete x from the list below − Update x.next.prev DELETE(L,x) if x.prev != NIL x.prev.next := x.next else L.head:= x.next if x.next != NIL x.next.prev := x.prev L.head 1 4 3 5 x Deletion of an element in doubly linked lists • Can be performed in constant time • Example − Delete x from the list below − Termination DELETE(L,x) if x.prev != NIL x.prev.next := x.next else L.head:= x.next if x.next != NIL x.next.prev := x.prev L.head 1 3 5 4 x Linked List operations we have reviewed 1.
