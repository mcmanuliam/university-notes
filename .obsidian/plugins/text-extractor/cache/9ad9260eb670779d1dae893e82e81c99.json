Dynamic vs Static.pdf","text":"Data Structures - Static vs Dynamic What is a “data structure”? “…As the term is used more precisely in computer science, adata structure is: •a collection of data values, •the relationships among them, and •the functions or operations that can be applied to the data. If any one of these three characteristics is missing or not stated precisely, the structure being examined does not qualify as a data structure.” “Encyclopedia of Computer Science:” https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1074100.1074312 Some Python data structures (we have already encountered) •Lists •“Mutable” •Size/content can be updated after initialization ➢a = [1, 'two', 3.0, 4, 'five'] ➢a[0]; a[0:3] ➢a.append('6'); a.pop() •Arrays •Mutable •Its objects are of the same, fixed type ➢a = array.array('i', range(1,6)) ➢a[0]; a[0:3] ➢a.append(6); a.pop() •Tuples •Immutable •Allow different types ➢a = (1, 'two', 3.0, 4, 'five') ➢a[0], a[0:3] 1 [1, 'two', 3.0] [1, 'two', 3.0, 4, 'five', '6'] '6' array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) 1 array('i', [1, 2, 3]) array('i', [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]) 6 1 (1, 'two', 3.0) Static vs dynamic data structures •Fixed vs variable size •Pros and cons: Dynamic (Memory allocated when required, at run-time) Static (Memory allocated when program is written, and it thus has a fixed size) Efficient use of memory (as much as “really” needed) Easier to insert/remove data We don’t need to know size in advance Memory usage can be wasteful Inserting/deleting elements is generally inefficient (part of array needs to be rewritten) Array size must be determined before use Static vs dynamic data structures •Fixed vs variable size •Pros and cons: Dynamic (Memory allocated when required, at run-time) Static (Memory allocated when program is written, and it thus has a fixed size) Efficient use of memory (as much as “really” needed)Memory allocated in advance, no risk of “running out” Easier to insert/remove data No need to worry about keeping track of size at run-time We don’t need to know size in advanceRandom access is easier Run the risk of “overflow” at run-time Memory usage can be wasteful Harder to implement (keep track of various data structure attributes, pointers, etc) Inserting/deleting elements is generally inefficient (part of array needs to be rewritten) Data can be “orphaned”, filling up memory with “garbage”Array size must be determined before use Dynamic data structures: this course •Linked Lists •Trees","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
