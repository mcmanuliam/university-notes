Why not always use the larger variables, such as long int and double instead of int and float to hold bigger numbers? 2. What happens if you put a number into a type that is not big enough to hold it? 3. In what variable type would you best store the following values? § The number of Facebook friends a person has § The radius of a circle § Your annual salary § A person’s first initial § The distance to a star in miles","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
