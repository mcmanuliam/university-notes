The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet • E.g. The set O of positive integers less than 10 7 Describing Sets • E.g. The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet • V = {a, e, i, o, u} • E.g. The set O of positive integers less than 10 • O = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9 } • | | denotes the cardinality of a set • |V| = 5, |O| = 5 8 Describing Sets • Two sets are equal if and only if they have the same elements • Order doesn’t matter • {1,3,5} = {1,5,3} = {3,1,5} = {3,5,1}= {5,1,3} ={5,3,1} • Repetition doesn’t matter • {1,2} = {1,1,2} = {1,2,2,2,2} Set Equality 10 Set Equality A = {1,2,3} B = {3,2,1} C = {1,1,2,2,2,3} D = {1,2,3} Which set(s) are equal to A? 11 Set Equality A = {1,2,3} B = {3,2,1} C = {1,1,2,2,2,3} D = {1,2,3} A = B, C and D Sets • Sets usually group together elements with associated properties • but seemingly unrelated properties can also be listed as a set • {2, e, Fred, Paris} is also a set • We just don’t know much about exactly how they are related to each other 12 Predicates and Sets • It is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements • What is the set of all integers less than 1 million? 13 • It is sometimes inconvenient or impossible to describe a set by listing all of its elements • What is the set of all integers less than 1 million? • {1,2,3,4,5……………………………………!!!!!!!} 14 Predicates and SetsSet Builder Notation • Characterise all those elements in the set by stating the properties they must have to be members E.g. • The set O of all positive integers less than 10 in set builder notation is: • O = {X | X is an odd integer less than 10} • More mathematical definitions are also OK: • O = {X | X ∊ ℕ ⋀ x < 10 ⋀ x % 2 == 1 } 15 • A predicate is sometimes used to indicate set membership • A predicate F(x) will be true or false, depending on whether x belongs to a set 16 Predicates and Sets An example {x | x is a positive integer less than 4} is the set {1,2,3} If t is an element of the set {x | F(x)} then the statement F(t) is true So if F(x) is defined as x % 2 = 0 {x|F (x)} contains…. the set of all even numbers 17 Here, F(x) is referred to as the predicate, and x the subject of the proposition Predicates and Set MembershipSome Notation • a ∈ A • a is an element of set A • a ∉ A • a is not an element of set A • Ø• The empty or null set • Also represented by { } 19 Graphical Representations • Sets can be represented graphically using Venn diagrams • The universal set U (which contains all of the objects under consideration) is represented by a rectangle • Inside the rectangle, circles are used to represent sets • Sometimes points are used to represent the particular elements of the set 20 An Example Set V The set V of vowels from all letters U U .a .e .o .i .u 21 U is the Universe – the set of all possible items T The set T of people in tutorial group from all Students S S .sue .bill .bruce .james .tom .clare 22 An Example SetSubsets A B A Ì B A is a subset of B A test that returns true iff A Ì B 23 Subsets (2) A B A ⊆ B A is a subset or equal to B A test that returns true iff A ⊆ B 24 • Given a set S, the power set is the set of all subsets of the set S • Denoted by P(S) or • E.g. the power set of {0,1,2} is … 25 The Power SetThe Power Set • E.g. the power set of {0,1,2} is • P({0,1,2}) = {Ø, {0}, {1}, {2}, {0,1}, {0,2}, {1,2}, {0,1,2} } • NB - the empty set and the set itself are members of this set of subsets • If a set has n elements, its power set has 2n elements • The power set does not contain numbers, it contains SETs 26 Set Operations • Two sets can be combined in many different ways - The following illustrates some such combinations 28 Union A È B The union of A and B A È B = {x | x Î A Ú x Î B } The set that contains those elements that are either in A, B, or in both Symbol like Union 29 Intersection A Ç B The intersection of A and B A Ç B = {x | x Î A Ù x Î B } Symbol like aNd 30 Difference A - B The difference of A and B A - B = {x | x Î A Ù x ÏB } 31 Complement A A The complement of A A = {x | x Ï A} 32 U Symmetric Difference A Å B = (A - B) È (B - A) The symmetric difference of A and B A Å B = {x | (x Î A Ù x ÏB) v (x Î B Ù x ÏA) } 33 Summary • What are sets? • Notation for making sets, comparing sets • Operators: making new sets from other sets • È union • Ç intersection • – difference • A complement • Å symmetric difference 34 Example Exam Questions Given the following sets: A = {1,3,7,9}, B = {2,4,6}, C = {7,9} determine the following (assume that P is the powerset operator): • |B| • P (B) • |P (C)| • A ∪ B • A ∩ C • Which of the following are true? Ø C Ì A Ø C Ì B = 3 = { {}, {2},{4},{6}, {2,4}, {4,6}, {2,4,6}, {2,6} } = 4 = {1,2,3,4,6,7,9} = {7,9} = TRUE = FALSE 35 Summary of Sets • What are sets? {1,3,5} • Set builder notation for making sets; comparing sets • Operators: making new sets from other sets • È union • Ç intersection • – difference • A complement • Å symmetric difference • So how does this help with databases? 36 Consider a query: “What are the grades of student 8187491?” How can we query the database to obtain this information? So why is this useful? Two ways of querying a database: • procedural (relational algebra, Pandas) Ø sequence of operations Ø the output of each operation is the input to the next operation result ← F4 (F2 (F1(tableA), tableB), F3(tableC)) • declarative (SQL) Ø describes the desired results (in terms of conditions) Ø the DBMS works out the operations result ← CONDITIONS (tableA, tableB, tableC) RA is key to understanding SQL query processing! This is based on set theory This is internally implemented as RA operations So why is this useful?A Relational Instance • This Student relation instance has: • Degree 4 and Cardinality 3 • A relation is a set of tuples (or n-tuples) • As each tuple has n values (same as degree of the relation) • E.g. <Fraser,880123,50,65> is a 4-tuple. name matric exam1 exam2 Gedge 891023 12 58 Kerr 892361 66 90 Fraser 880123 50 65 STUDENT Schema N-tuples are not Sets • The order of elements in a collection is sometimes important • But sets are unordered, so a different structure is needed • This is provided by ordered n-tuples • <2,1,5> is an 3-tuple N-tuples • Two ordered n-tuples are equal if and only if each corresponding pair of their elements is equal • <a1,a2,….an> = <b1,b2,…..bn> if and only if ai=bi for i=1,2,…n • {1, 3, 5} = {3, 1, 5} = TRUE for SETS • <1, 3, 5> = <3, 1, 5> = FALSE for N-TUPLES • NB: We can use <> or () to denote tuples, but not {} Cartesian Product Let A and B be sets • The cartesian product of A and B (A X B) is • the set of all ordered pairs (i.e. tuples) <a,b> where a ∈ A and b ∈ B A={0,1}, B={a,b,c} A X B = Let A and B be sets • The cartesian product of A and B (A X B) is • the set of all ordered pairs (i.e. tuples) <a,b> where a ∈ A and b ∈ B A={0,1}, B={a,b,c} A X B = {<0,a>,<0,b>,<0,c>, <1,a>, <1,b> ,<1,c>} Cartesian ProductConnecting to Databases: Representing a Relation Forename = {Marilyn, Quintin, Simon, Henrik} Surname = {McGee, Cutts, Gay} Names = {<Marilyn,McGee>,<Quintin,Cutts>, <Simon, Gay>} Cutts McGee Gay Marilyn Quintin Simon Henrik R Cutts McGee Gay Marilyn x Quintin x Simon x Henrik DomainsDomains A Relationship and its Equivalent Relation Lecturer' Course' MMcG' CS1Q' QC' CS1CT' SGay' CS1P' SGay' CS1Q' ' Lecturer CourseTeaches m n initials code Teaches Initials( MMcG( QC( SGay( HRight( RInnis( ( Code% CS1Q% CS1CT% CS1P% % Lecturer Course The Table as a Relation Lecturers = {MM, QC, SG, HR, RI} Courses = {CS1P, CS1Q, CS1CT} Teaches = {<MM, CS1Q>, <QC, CS1CT>, <SG, CS1P>, <SG,CS1Q>} CS1P CS1Q MM QC HR SG Teaches' CS1P' CS1Q' CS1CT' MM' ' x' ' QC' ' ' x' SG' X' X' ' HR' ' ' ' RI' ' ' ' ' RI CS1CT","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
