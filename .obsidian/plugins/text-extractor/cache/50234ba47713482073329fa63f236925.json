Classifying the palette as one of the previously mentioned classes 2. Clustering the colours based on their overall purpose within the palette Training with Synthetic Data ● Training on artificially generated data can be convenient ○ No issues with dataset size ○ Can control quality ● However, any discrepancy between the synthetic distribution and real world data can decrease your model’s generalization ○ This typically comes in the form of overfitting Pretraining on Real World Data ● Training from synthetic data can often lead to collapse in a local minimum ● To resolve this, the model was first trained using Sim-CLR on colour palettes sourced from existing VeryConnect customers + the open source WikiArt dataset * These loss curves are from quite early in the data generation / hyper parameter tuning process Random Transforms and LAB When generating a colour palette for training, first an “idealised” colour palette is generated belonging to a random class. Next, random transforms are performed. Importantly, these transforms shouldn’t change the palette’s class. Humans perceive colour in a non-uniform way which standard colour spaces (e.g. RGB) don’t account for. LAB does. “Idealised” split-complementary palette After LAB space transforms Results Prediction: Monochromatic Synthetic Data Using clusters to analyse a https://www.cmhp.org.uk/ Logos Task Extract the company logo from a website Approach One: OCR + Fuzzy String Similarity cinfo Biel Bern New location, proven services Approach One: OCR + Fuzzy String Similarity cinfo Biel Bern New location, proven services Match to Keys cinfo Careers in International Cooperation | International development, humanitarian aid, peacebuilding | cinfo … User-provided/auto-generated keys Return Image with Highest Match 80+% accuracy on VeryConnect Customers Approach Two: A Bespoke Model Using a set of 1,391 companies, we set up a site to manually label logo images sourced from their homepages along with a set of google search results Data Gathering The Part of AI Everyone Tries to Avoid The Model 1. A vision model (potentially pre-trained on a publicly available logo dataset produces a latent vector for each image 2. A transformer processes these vectors (with additional metadata), selecting the logos from them Results ● Due to the time-consuming nature of the data gathering process, along with challenges and time pressures from other parts of the project, we were only able to gather around 100 training examples ● Top-1 accuracy on an unseen portion of the dataset: 64% ● This number may be higher with a larger dataset, but the trade off in time dedication may not be worth it","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
