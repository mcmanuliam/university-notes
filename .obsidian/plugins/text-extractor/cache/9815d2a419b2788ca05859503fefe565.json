Controlled, can focus and limit research effort; uncontrolled can undermine research quality Fieldwork • Being there, observe, ask insightful questions • Interviewing: “ethnographer's most important data gathering technique” • Explain and put into context what you see/experience • Study every word for subcultural connotations • Document what you’ve seen and heard • Notepads, audio, video, photo, survey • Analysis at various stages - field notes, reports • Information gathered can be subjective and misleading • Cross-check, compare (triangulate) before using as a basis of knowledge • Classical ethnographies might take 6 months to 2 years on fieldwork. Maybe 2 weeks every few months. Ethnography in HCI • Computers are used for communication / collaboration • Used in existing groups (work, education), or purely virtual (forums, communities) • Norms and dynamics of those groups are important to study • How systems are used • How design affects the way they’re used • Consists of a combination of observation, interviews, participation methods Ethnography in HCI • Involves understanding • the problem, context, Groups, group interactions, new technologies (but also old systems) • Involves Participatory Design in different stages of design cycle • Early stages to gain deep understanding of system requirements • Later stages to gain deep understanding of how a product is being used (in a particular setting, or by a particular group), so can redesign to better support users • Study a combination of range of technologies in a particular setting Designing a New System for Unfamiliar Domain • Ex: Design of a new healthcare information management system in a different country • You may need to observe users, workplace etc. • Can be rooted in context of how target users work and interact • Organisational concerns (unfamiliar domain) • Work practices (specific to healthcare or the culture) • People’s values and dynamics (cultural) • Types of interactions between people • Don't assume users are 'just like you’ (we cover more of this in the ethical class in later weeks) Example – Designing a New System for Unfamiliar Domain • Can learn more through conducting site visits • Potentially for days/weeks • Observe • Interview • ‘Shadow’ them • As start to understand how they work and what they need, can begin listing requirements & designing • Discuss with potential users – for approval or to correct misperceptions • Try with different users, possibly in different setting Example – designing a new system for unfamiliar domain • Ethnography can be complex, time-consuming and expensive • Could we use surveys / interviews to learn about requirements instead? • Maybe – that’s certainly easier/cheaper! • If early stages and this is unfamiliar area, don't know what to ask • People’s descriptions of what they do are often inaccurate • Poor at explaining • Misremember • They don't realise what they do • Bias (e.g. socially acceptable answers) Example: Participant Observation for Design Inspiration Ethnography in Online Communities • Analyse collaborative play in World of Warcraft • Authors performed a lot of gameplay – active participants • Wanted to know what players were experiencing • Make recommendations to improve For reference: https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1180898 Autoethnography • Autoethnography is a genre of ethnography that draws on your own lived experiences rather than the traditional “objective ethnographies” which some see as an attempt to accurate descriptions of the world. • Involves your own point of view, situating you as the protagonist and narrator • Personal account is valuable within itself as see you as an individual, social and cultural levels all tied together For Reference: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-73374-6_3 Autoethnography Example • When I develop systems for dog, often it is an exploration of my own dog and myself technology usage • A way to understand the technology more deeply as a designer and participant Ethnography Challenges • Requires a lot of skills • Skills in conversation • Data interpretation • What to pay attention to (and that it can change) • Whom to talk to • Fit to the place/group being studied • Expensive, time-consuming (and personally challenging) • Often used in 3 contexts • Users not well understood • Tasks not well understood • Safety-critical systems Observation Techniques • Observation can be of two types: • Passive observation of everyday activities without active participation or intervention • Maybe not integrating into any community – just watching public spaces • Participant observation • Or ‘participatory observation’. Combines participation in the lives of those being studied with appropriate professional distance Participant Observation • One can be a complete participant • Become part of community as much as possible • May take years • Risk: losing ability to be detached – “going native” • Covert observation – don’t tell community you’re a researcher. • Ethically challenging! • Or, a complete observer • Opposite end of scale. Don’t interact directly • Can integrate quicker into 'own' culture – already an ‘insider’ • But if too familiar, can take events for granted and leave data unrecorded Interview Techniques • Structured Interviews • Each participant answers same questions • Verbal approximation of questionnaire • Maybe appropriate when one has explicit research goals • Semi-Structured Interviews • Each participant answers the same questions, but additional questions and follow-up questions can be added as needed • Unstructured Interviews • Interview may have little or no set structure • Could be tool for early evaluation, where one doesn’t have firm idea of specific research questions Designing an Interview • Start with a Survey • Designed to elicit a broad picture of the participant’s experience • Good for building rapport and establishing the scope of interviews • Survey should include Specific Questions (see previous weeks) • Designed to gather feedback on specific categories, attributes, and themes • Ask both Open and Close Ended Questions • see other slides for details of closed/open • Balance of structured and unstructured responses Designing an Interview • Many issues familiar from survey lecture • e.g. recall bias – if asking about past behaviour, do it soon after • Close-ended questions • “Do you have previous experience with VR?” • Open-ended questions • “Tell me about your previous experience with VR?” • Might be better to do as interview rather than survey • Probably longer open-ended answers • Can ask follow-up questions • But much more time consuming • Can do interview and survey together (nice combination of research methods) Running an Interview • Respect for the context the interviewee is coming from • Respect for the interviewee • Strategies • Be honest, be yourself • Focus on learning from participants • Be perceptive, know when to press and when to let go • Understand silence and use it (important!!!!) • Being a good interviewer is a skill you can develop with experience Key Actors • In ethnographic setting, “some people are more articulate and culturally sensitive than others” • You will also find some users respond better to your ideas, provide more useful feedback, and act as “star users” • Balance star users or key actors with the dataset • However, over-reliance can be dangerous • Cross-check with others to ensure they’re providing reliable information • Can be ethically challenging • e.g., care situations, and other power dynamics Standard Ethics Checklist 1. Participants were not exposed to any risks greater than those encountered in their normal working life. 2. The experimental materials were paper-based, or comprised software running on standard hardware 3. All participants explicitly stated that they agreed to take part, and that their data could be used in the project 4. No incentives were offered to the participants. 5. No information about the evaluation or materials was intentionally withheld from the participants. 6. No participant was under the age of 16. 7. No participant has an impairment that may limit their understanding or communication. 8. Neither I nor my supervisor is in a position of authority or influence over any of the participants. 9. All participants were informed that they could withdraw at any time. All participants have the right to withdraw at any time during the investigation. 10. All participants have been informed of my contact details. 11. The evaluation was discussed with all the participants at the end of the session, and all participants had the opportunity to ask questions. 12. All the data collected from the participants is stored in an anonymous form. All participant data (hard-copy and soft-copy) should be stored securely, and in anonymous form. NOTE: We will go into challenging ethical situations in later sessions Analysing Qualitative Data • Analysing data from e.g. • interviews • focus groups (a group of participants having a discussion on a topic directed by a researcher.) • open-ended questionnaire responses from surveys • Transcribe any audio data • Tools out there e.g., Otter etc. • Familiarise yourself with all data • Content coding • Deductive: start with a pre-specified questions in mind • Inductive: No hypothesis, codes emerge from data Analysing Qualitative Data • Inductive approaches: Thematic analysis • Go through the data and identify “themes”, these themes become your outcomes. • Affinity diagrams are one of the easiest ways to do thematic analysis with a group or by yourself (normally in group to avoid bias) • Pros: Pulls the main concepts of the data out, Easy for someone else to understand, Themes are grounded in the data with clear examples • Cons: Only works with a small amount of data (typically depends on the amount of people) and may require more than one person to improve validity Analysing Qualitative Data • Inductive approaches • Thematic analysis • Grounded theory (only when no other framework!) • Also sometimes called Grounded Theory Method (GTM) • No preconceived theories; open mind • Theory eventually ‘emerges’ from the process Analysing Qualitative Data • Qualitative Coding – loosely separated ‘stages’ • Stage 1. Open coding • Identify distinct pieces of information; assign open code • In-vivo coding: use participants’ own words to define codes • Size / scope of pieces determined by researcher’s interpretive process • Stage 2. Axial coding • Organise open codes into set of concepts / categories • Think about relationships between concepts • Don’t need to all be same level of specificity, or need even numbers of codes assigned • Stage 3. Selective coding • In grounded theory, combing concepts into main theory • Re-code original transcripts using new concept framework • Can verify with multiple coders at various stages Example Transcript • From focus group on viewing media while travelling • participants numbered; interviewer is 0 Example Transcript • From focus group on viewing media while travelling • participants numbered; interviewer is 0 Code 1: Preference for tablet Code 2: Choice important Code 3: Privacy Issue Code 4: Placement Issue Example Transcript • From focus group on viewing media while travelling • participants numbered; interviewer is 0 Example Transcript • From focus group on viewing media while travelling • participants numbered; interviewer is 0 THEME 1: PRIVACY and ERGONIMICS Code 3: Privacy Issue Code 4: Placement Issue THEME 1: DEVICE AND CONTENT Code 1: Preference for tablet Code 2: Choice important Reporting Results • If a thematic analysis uncovers 5 main themes • Create 5 subsections, where you explain each theme • “You can provide participant quotes” [P12] and add them to the theme descriptions • This helps create more valuable findings but raises ethical issues • Can relate to a user summary table, where 1 row per user and info provided on age, level of experience, job… • Discuss overall findings • Put in context of related work – reinforce other findings, contradict, expand scope, consider different factors…? • Might lead to implications for future designs Questions? Comments? Concerns? Interview Task Task 1: In your teams, write five interview questions on one of the topics below (same as the survey topics from yesterday): Option 1: Measure how frequently people play mobile games in the workplace. Option 2: Measure student's attitudes to using AI to write assignments. For these questions, look at the answers you got yesterday and see what more information you would like. (15 mins) Task 2: Split your group in half, and send half of your group to interview another group using the set of questions you created. The other half remains and gets interviewed by the other group. (10 mins) Task 3: Talk in your group about what you found and how this can help towards the research question and what you learned about interviewing, and being interviewed. (10 mins) Interview Task: Class Discussion Reading: Ethnography in HCI All of Chapter 9.5 Some Examples Talks on home settings, work settings, educational settings in mobile and ubiquitous systems and virtual Not required but the whole chapter covers much of today if you want a re-cap.
