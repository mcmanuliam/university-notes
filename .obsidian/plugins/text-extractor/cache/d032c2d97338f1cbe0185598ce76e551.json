Relational Data Model - Enforcing Integrity.pdf","text":"Data Storage and Retrieval Lecture 5 Relational Data Model: Enforcing Integrity Dr. Graham McDonald Graham.McDonald@glasgow.ac.uk Overview • More on the Relational Model • Integrity • Next lectures • Sets and Relations • Relational Algebra 2 Remainder: ER -> Schema • Strong entities • build a table with columns for each attribute • Weak entities • build a table with columns for each attribute • Add the PK of the owner entity as FK; composite PK • Relationships • 1-1– FK any side • 1-N – FK N side • N-M – new table containing FKs; composite PK 3 The Relational Model 4 The Relational Model • Recall: In the relational model of a database, all data is represented in terms of tuples, grouped into relations. • A database organised in terms of the relational model is a relational database. 5 A Relation • A relation may be thought of as a 2D table • A relation has • a name - STUDENT • In the header: an unchanging set of columns which are named and typed (domain) – i.e. the scheme Ø Student(name, StudentID, exam1, exam2) • In the body: a time varying set of tuples, which are the current set of records for the relation name Student ID exam1 exam2 Gedge 891023 12 58 Kerr 892361 66 90 Fraser 880123 50 65 STUDENT 6 Degree and Cardinality of a Relation • The relation student has: • Degree of 4 (number of attributes/columns) • Cardinality of 3 (number of rows/tuples) name matric exam1 exam2 Gedge 891023 12 58 Kerr 892361 66 90 Fraser 880123 50 65 STUDENT GOTCHA: Do not confuse this with the cardinality of a relationship type in an E/R diagram 7 Characteristics of the Relational Model • A relation is a set of tuples • e.g. {<Fraser,880123,50,65>, ….} • There are no duplicate tuples • because the tuples form a set • this must be checked when • a new tuple is added • a value is modified • a new relation is created as a restriction of an old one • This implies that a primary key always exists • Worst case = a key composed of all of the attributes 8 Characteristics of the Relational Model (2) • The tuples are unordered • a property of sets • no meaning is imposed on the relation (we could use any order) • a table is only one possible representation of a relation • physical storage of a relation must however have an order 9 Characteristics of the Relational Model (3) • Attributes are also an unordered set • nothing can be inferred from the way we write the set of names or draw a table representation • no notion of getting the first attribute, next attribute, etc. Ø no first tuple or next tuple 10 S# PQ S1 {(P1,200),(P2,300)} Characteristics of the Relational Model (4) • All values are atomic • no attribute can have a value which is either a set or is decomposable • So NO MULTI-VALUED attributes • This simplifies the model • called the First Normal Form Assumption S# P Q S1 P1 200 S1 P2 300 must become 11 Characteristics of the Relational Model (5) • Relations represent • an entity type and its attributes • a relationship • a set of values • Unknown values must be represented • replaced by NULL 12 Null Values • When adding a new tuple, we might not have all the data we need • The tuple for STUDENT Smith has a NULL value for Exam2 • This is okay if the model allows….but what about if we wanted a NULL value for matric number?  Primary keys cannot be allowed to take NULL values name matric exam1 exam2 Gedge 891023 12 58 Kerr 892361 66 90 Fraser 880123 50 65 Smith 882854 89 NULL 13 Integrity 14 Constraints on Relational Databases • Inherent integrity constraints: • must hold for all relational databases • typically enforced by DBMS • Enterprise constraints: • specific to a particular application 15 Integrity Constraints • Primary key values must be unique • Primary key values cannot be NULL • Foreign key values: • must exist in the primary key of the referenced relations – we call this referential integrity • may be NULL (if it is not a mandatory participation) • NB: In MySQL, foreign keys are constraints that need a unique name. • I suggest a notation including both tables: e.g. “fk_Star_Studio” 16 Enterprise Constraints • Application dependent • Examples: • specified non-key attributes must not be NULL e.g.: all students must have a name, even if the primary key is the student number • values of one attribute must be less than values in another attribute e.g.: age of parent must be greater than age of child • SQL standards compliant DBMS platforms allow user- defined constraints to be checked when data is inserted/updated 17 Referential Integrity • Concerns the use of Foreign Keys • Guarantees that relationships between tuples are coherent • Every non-NULL value in a Foreign Key must also exist in the relation for which it is the Primary Key 18 (Recap) Foreign Keys: Definition • A foreign key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that exist in more than one table and which is the primary key for one of those tables. • The foreign key is used to cross-reference between tables • A foreign key is a referential constraint between two tables, i.e. a value in a foreign key MUST exist in the referenced primary key • A table may have multiple foreign keys and each foreign key may reference a different table • Foreign keys need not have the same attribute name across tables • Could be Release(MovieTitle,Year, Length) • Names should differ to help readability! 19 Enforcing Referential Integrity • Rules for each foreign key must be enforced independently by the database system • Improper foreign key/primary key relationships or not enforcing those relationships are often the source of many database and data modeling problems 20 Enforcing Referential Integrity • What happens if we want to update or delete a row of a table? (A very likely database operation) 21 Referential Integrity: 3 Strategies • Restrict – ban any alterations to a primary key if there are foreign key references to it • Cascade - cascade the effect to all relations in all tables that refer to it • Set to NULL – allow update in original table, set all corresponding FK values to null 22 Referential Integrity: Examples • Schema: • Staff(Payroll# : INT, name: VARCHAR(10)) • Students(matric# : INT, name : VARCHAR(10), adviser : INT) • A foreign key constraint exists, where Students.adviser refers to Staff.payroll# payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 8556 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 8556 789 Blair 8450 STAFF STUDENTS 23 What is the domain of the the adviser attribute? Adviser : { 8000, 8450, 8856, NULL } 24 • What to do if the referent of a foreign key is changed (edited or deleted)? payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 8556 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 8556 789 Blair 8450 EXAMPLES: 1. What if Lennon’s payroll number changes to 7990? 2. What if Gray’s record is deleted? STAFF STUDENTS Referential Integrity: Examples payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 8556 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 8556 789 Blair 8450 STAFF STUDENTS 25 Referential Integrity: Example 1 • What if Lennon’s payroll number changes to 7990?• What if Lennon’s payroll number changes to 7990? payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 7990 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 8556 789 Blair 8450 referential integrity violated STAFF STUDENTS 26 Referential Integrity: Example 1 payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 7990 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 7990 789 Blair 8450 solution: cascade STAFF STUDENTS 27 • What if Lennon’s payroll number changes to 7990? Referential Integrity: Example 1 • What if Gray’s record is deleted? payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 7990 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 7990 789 Blair 8450 STAFF STUDENTS 28 Referential Integrity: Example 2 payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 7990 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 7990 789 Blair 8450 STAFF STUDENTS referential integrity violated 29 • What if Gray’s record is deleted? Referential Integrity: Example 2 payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 7990 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 7990 789 Blair NULL STAFF STUDENTS Solution: Set to NULL 30 • What if Gray’s record is deleted? Referential Integrity: Example 2Referential Integrity: Example 2 • What if Gray’s record is deleted? payroll# name 8000 Johnson 8450 Gray 7990 Lennon matric# name adviser 123 Jones NULL 456 Smith 7990 789 Blair NULL STAFF STUDENTS Solution: Restrict – raise an error, abort the transaction 31 Error Number: 1451 Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails Integrity in MySQL Workbench • Integrity – controlled by a dialogue box • See Foreign Keys Tab of Table Editor 32 1. Check that Movie’s Title is a Primary Key • And note its datatype e.g. VARCHAR(50) Movie(Title, Type, Studio, SequelOf) Release(MovieTitle, Year, Length) where Release Title is a FK reference to Movie Title Our Schema: 33 Steps for Creating a Foreign Key 2. Create all attributes in Release, including those attributes that will be Foreign Keys • Make sure that FKs attributes have correct datatype – it MUST be the SAME as the PK attribute you intend do refer to • Press Apply BEFORE creating the FK constraints Movie(Title, Type, Studio, SequelOf) Release(MovieTitle, Year, Length) where Release Title is a FK reference to Movie Title Our Schema: 34 Steps for Creating a Foreign Key 35 3. Add a Foreign Key constraint for Release • Name the constraint, e.g. “fk_release_movie” • Select Movie as the referenced table • Select MovieTitle as the (foreign key) column of this table, and Title as the referenced (primary key) column • 4. Choose a referencing strategy (e.g. CASCADE) Movie(Title, Type, Studio, SequelOf) Release(MovieTitle, Year, Length) where Release Title is a FK reference to Movie Title Our Schema: This name must be globally unique in your DB: “Title” will not work (i) the foreign key attribute name (ii) the referenced table & its PK attribute name(s) (iii) a name for the constraint itself Names… Steps for Creating a Foreign Key Workbench Table Editor: Foreign Keys 36 1. Select Foreign keys tab 2. Make a name for this constraint 3. Select the referenced table 4. Select the foreign key column in this relation, and what attribute it refers to in the referenced table Then click ‘Apply’ to save the table to the DBMS 5. Referencing strategy FK Checklist • Foreign Keys are difficult! If things go wrong: 1. Do not panic 2. Read the SQL error message, it will give a hint 3. Check… • … that you are referencing a PK • … that the datatypes of the PK and FK attributes match • … If you have a composite PK, you must also have a composite FK 4. Google the error message 5. If all else fails, close the Workbench tabs and try again 37 An EER Diagram  Use the ‘reverse engineer schema’ functionality to view the relationships ¡ NB: Looks slightly different from the ER diagram? Many-to-many relationships become Relations Cardinality notation differs Solid lines are identifying relationships 38 Practical Tips • Create the tables in the same order as the Translating E-R Diagram to Relational Schema rules • Create Strong entities first • Weak entities next • When creating a foreign key constraint, the referenced table & column must already exist! • Which order to create these tables? • Movie(Title, Type, Studio, SequelOf) • Release(Title, Year, Length) • Stars(Name, Address, Studio, Salary) • Studio(Name, Address) ¡ 3 ¡ 4 ¡ 2 ¡ 1 39 Some Tips! • Follow the stepwise guide – it works! • Write a schema first – then go to access to build the tables • Add the entities OWN attributes – then decide what FKs to add • Use “Reverse Engineer Schema” to view the result • Be careful to select good data types – they must match when you go to connect PKs and FKs • When connecting relationships – think what is the referent PK and what is referring FK 40","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
