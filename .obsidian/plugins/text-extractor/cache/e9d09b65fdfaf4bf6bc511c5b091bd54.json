Revision & Quiz User Interaction Topics 7 Imagine you are a researcher studying how people use smartphones in their daily lives. You decide to conduct an in-the-wild study to observe users in their natural environments. Which of the following is a key advantage of this approach? a) You can easily replicate the study conditions across different locations. b) You can precisely measure the impact of individual features on user behavior. c) You can observe genuine user interactions with their smartphones in real-world settings. d) You can complete the study faster than in a controlled lab environment. 8 Example quiz question 9 Add-On: Statistic • Know when to use • Not how. • Terminology • Ranks = ordinal • Paired = within For reference: https://dzchilds.github.io/stats-for-bio/choosing-models-and-tests.html Ethics 10 • Ethics are important in HCI research. • Often borrow from psychology research • Crucial notion of informed consent. Inform participants about: • Understand • nature of research • methodology • risks or benefits • Right not to participate or to withdraw • Right to anonymity and confidentiality • Particular issues in HCI: • Work can involve recruitment of vulnerable groups (e.g. when investigating assistive technology), or • Deception that might be involved during a study. Ethics 11 • Do people know what we’re doing? • That the itis University research? • The purpose of the experiment? • What information is being recorded? • What will we do with this info? • How to opt out? 12 Ethical Challenges: Informed consent • State the purpose of the study - URL to project site • All logging explained and must be explicitly agreed to before usage • Store / transmit data securely • Email address opt out at any time on request → have all collected data destroyed • Multiple languages If necessary Terms & Conditions Page 1314 • Hungry Yoshi study asked! • In-app questionnaire: 1,226 responses. Yes: 20% No: 80% • Telephone interviews: 11 interviewees. Yes: 0 No:11 • Opening the full T&C document: • 75,818 agreed to T&Cs. 2% opened doc • Of 2%, nobody spent >60 sec reading the 842 words Do users read the T&Cs? 15 • Interpreting existing guidelines to cover large scale mobile HCI • Framework categorizing trials based on participant ‘risk’ • Advice for how to run each type of trial in ethical manner • Experiments on new ethical procedures Researching Ethics 16 • Human trials in Psychology: BPS & APA – Autonomy, Dignity, Self-Determination – Concern for Others’ Welfare – Social Responsibility – Scientific Value, Integrity, Competence • Internet-Mediated Research Interpreting Existing Guidelines 17 • Restrict age of users where stores allow • Graphics, icon sets, descriptive language • Terms & Conditions in store description & in- app • Historic log data not on externally-visible server • Privacy-preserving data publishing techniques General Guidelines 18 • Work with human • Work with cybersickness • Work with alcohol →Even necessary? →Informed Consent →Screening →Drug usage →Susceptibility to addiction →Medical professionals onsite →Regular testing during (breath) 19 Case Study 1: • Work with humans • They eat different food → Informed Consent → Screening: →Allergies →Intolerances →Food preferences → Hygiene before and during 20 Case Study: Big issue? Data. Privacy. 21 • So many different forms of research → hard to make ‘one size fits all’ set of guidelines • Identified 2 main dimensions of participant ‘risk’ – Anonymous vs identifiable – User expectation of app’s data access • Categorize existing trials on this framework Categorised Ethical Framework For reference: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2470654.2466245 22 4 Quadrants: • AE: Anonymous, Expected • AU: Unexpected, anonymous • IE: Identifiable, expected • IU: Identifiable, unexpected Categorised Ethical Framework 23 • e.g., Aggregate download/usage stats • e.g., Logging data that is integral to app usage, but cannot be used to identify user • Generally low risk • Advice: • General guidelines sufficient • Terms & Conditions pages to explain research, etc. 24 Anonymous, Expected • e.g., a game looking at ‘unnecessary’ data: how many contacts you have, contents of media library... • Advice • Pop-ups to gain explicit consent for each new data type captured • Mobile OSs now incorporate this 25 Anonymous, Unexpected • e.g., location sharing apps, social media apps • Advice • Provide functionality to browse data and delete specific parts • Effectively allowing ‘opt out’ at any time 26 Identifiable, Expected • e.g., a game looking at ‘unnecessary’ data that could identify a user: location • Highest risk • Advice • Actively interrupt users • Show them examples of recorded data • ! 27 Identifiable, Unexpected • T&C read rates suggest we need to find a better alternative to T&Cs • Alternative idea, based on interruption • Visual representation of log data • Delayed presentation of information • Personalized with user’s own data 28 Identifiable, Unexpected: Interruption • Hungry Yoshi • 1007 users; between-groups design • Hash function on the device’s unique ID to randomly assign to a condition Example: Interruption User Study For reference: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2639189.2639239 29 Concern Following Interruption Mann-Whitney U test: significant difference between conditions (p<0.01) 30 • Can be extended to many forms of data • Collect data only locally on device for a short period at start • Interrupt user with visual depiction of her own data • If they agree to participate, upload collected data, keep logging • If they disagree, destroy collected data without it ever leaving the device • Should be more engagement of users generally • Ethics as active area of research • Not just box to tick Discussion 34 Various Users 35 • Children • Older Adults • Learning and Cognitive Disabilities • Physical Limitations • Accessibility Needs • Animals • Plants/ Non-Human Objects? Different types of users 36 • Children have been users of technology for the last two decades: 42% of children in the UK own a tablet between 5-7 (Burns & Gottschalk, 2019) • As children increasingly become users, we need to understand better how research methods in Human-Computer Interaction can be adapted to address children →Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) • CCI focuses on how to develop new methods to design and evaluate how children interact with novel technologies • Children counted as a vulnerable group Child-Computer Interaction (CCI) 37 • Consent is different → Often through parents/caregivers • Children's understanding of the world is different → Understanding of computers different • Power dynamics (parent/caregiver) • Children's roles in life are different • Attention to task is different Challenges in CCI 38 • User observation (watching play) • Semi-structured interviews • Self-developed questionnaires or standardized questionaries • Creative sessions/ workshops • Activity Logging • User testing • Diary keeping • Focus Group • Cooperative Inquiry (e.g., kid reporter technique), bags of stuff, sticky noting • Free Interviews • Brainstorming • Physiological measurements (e.g., eye tracking, emotion tracking) • Probes • Card sorting • Robots Methods in CCI 39 • 67% of researchers use multiple methods • These methods can be classified as passive or active • User, Tester, Informant, Design Partner • Builds on Hart’s Ladder of Participation (UN initiative) • Researchers stress to involve children in the design of things they use • It isn't easy to involve diverse children →Important not to over burden Methods in CCI For Reference: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212868921000908 40 • Important that users can voice opinion on technology that they use • But – children have different language ability, reading age, and motor skills as well as confidence, self-belief and the desire to please. • Fun toolkit https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1139073.1139096 Example: Surveys with Children Again, again Method examples 41 • Unique challenges in designing technologies for and with older adults • Older adults more likely to experience accessibility-related challenges • Characteristics of life stage, history of learning, using different technologies, generational perspectives and social context all affect their technology usage • How to you create a concept of older people 1. Individuals in need of help due to age-related decline 2. Individuals that make contributions to families and society despite their age 3. ? Older Adults For reference: https://doi.org/10.1145/3290607.3299025 43 1. Individuals in need of help: • Technologies to compensate for “downsides of aging” • Help in a wide range of daily living independently 2. Individuals that contribute: • Supporting social relationships, creativity, and personal interests in relation to age-related decline in functional capabilities • Older people, however, are not a well-defined category of users • Growing movement towards participatory approach → partners, nut just users. Older Adults Challenges For reference: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107158191730099X 44 • Older adults as individual; do not always need own category • Older people are often part of the same ecosystem within the population • Avoids “othering” • Try to use a more situating lens e.g., ethnography: → Often, advice is not to recruit; go into their everyday life • Recognize older people's needs as context-dependent • Think across ages • Employ user-centered design approaches Older Adults Recommendations For reference: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S107158191730099X 45 • Co-design with 16 older adults (55- 85+) • 12 co-design sessions • Designed technologies for child (student)-adult relationships • Found forming partnerships is complex • Found students often made assumptions and co-design provides more meaningful experiences Example: Older Adults For reference: https://doi.org/10.1145/33362 47 If you had to place a bet, would you say personal computing has made life better or worse for people living with disabilities? Disabilities 48 • We have no way of knowing the answer to this question, it’s too big and there are a lot of confounding variables • And what even is “computing”… • There are many, many specific benefits: • Telemedicine lets you connect with healthcare workers remotely • New monitoring technologies • Biometric sensors to better understand healthcare challenges • Insights into New Drug Creation • New ways to connect with others when you can’t easily leave home • But? Disabilities 49 • But, if you think that the answer is obvious, you probably need to think again – “The digital divide” or “digital exclusion” is the gap in opportunities that has emerged between people with easy access to modern computing and people without • On the wrong side: • People in rural communities, • older people, • less educated people, and • people living with long-term health problems • Banking, job searches, study opportunities, taxes, etc. are all far harder if you are anything other than digitally fluent Disabilities: Not everyone is on equal 50 • Telemedicine? • Healthcare worker might be only outside contact. • New monitoring technologies • What if you don’t like being monitored in your home 24/7? • Biometric sensors to better understand healthcare challenges • Have surprisingly few benefits... • Insights into new drug creation with large computational networks • Are great so long as you can access the drugs • New ways to connect with others when you can’t easily leave home • Comes with diminished quality of connection built right in Deeper Problems 51 • The User-centred principle (UCD) says that the most important person to consider when designing a new product is the person who will actually use it. This seems intuitively obvious, but it often doesn’t happen in the real world because.... →We don’t know what they think until we give them the product → The user doesn’t usually pay for the design of the product so has little influence over the design process →We can make the mistake of thinking that we are the end user Why do we get it wrong? 52 • Patients are a long way from the design process which typically starts with businesses or hospital groups observing problems or maybe healthcare professionals... • Our intuition when dealing with long-term health problems is bad - we (designers) often live very different lives to people with long-term health problems • Lots of people living with disabilities are also older people – a double whammy (as we just spoke about) in terms of experience-gap for young professionals in the design industry UCD and Disability? 53 • Accessibility → most basic of approach • A range of heuristics that can be used to build interfaces and websites that are usable for people living with a range of different disabilities • The Nielsen Group and W3C both have comprehensive guides to making accessible digital tech • Color schemes, font sizes, text controls, alt-text, menu layout, button sizes and rendering on-screen, image choice, … • But we tend only to mean usable when we say accessible – there are many examples of tech that is usable but not useful What can we do? 55 Advanced: User-Sensitive Inclusive Design for Dynamic Diversity • User Sensitive – use design practices that include people unlike you • Inclusive Design – design for a multitude of abilities/disabilities • Dynamic Diversity – health challenges aren’t fixed in place • Diversity – the population living with health problems is MORE diverse than the population living without health problems • Older adults are a more diverse group than younger adults • the richest are richer, the poorest are poorer, • the healthiest are healthier, • the most challenged face more challenges, etc What can we do about poor design? 56 For reference: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10209-010-0203-y Questions?
