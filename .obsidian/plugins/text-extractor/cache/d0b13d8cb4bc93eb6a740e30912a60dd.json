We've fought the Megacorps to a standstill, cybered ourselves to the very limit of psychosis, and have even climbed to the heights of the Arasaka Towers to pimp smack old Saburo upside his bald head. This is one of the problems all designers who work within a self-created world face: terminal stagnation. Your players have done everything, fought everything, and seen everything you can offer in the original iteration of your world, and there's not much left to do. In Cyberpunk, my solution has always been to treat the entire world like a giant comic book, divided up into roughly ten-year story arcs. The Cyberpunk world goes to hell beginning in 1993, starting with the invention of modern cyber- ware and the attack on the World Trade Center in New York by Colombian narco-terrorists. We start the main Cyberpunk story (what I call the Never Fade Away Arc) ten years later in 2013 with the culmination being Johnny Silverhand's invasion of the Arasaka Tower in an attempt to rescue his girlfriend, Alt Cunningham. Ten more years pass and then begins the Cyberpunk 2020 Arc (which I call the Fall of the Towers Arc… starting to see a pattern here, what with me destroying big buildings all the time?) by the end of which the Cyberpunk world is totally disrupted in 2023. Working in story arcs is useful. It allows you to keep the main world operational while creating new storylines and introducing new characters. You get to build on what is already there and familiar. But by the end of the 2020 Arc, I had two big problems. First, it wasn't going to be enough simply to start a new storyline. I had to deal with the fact that much of the existing world had been mined out and needed a reset. And second, I'd acquired some partners. See, about the same time I started writing what would one day become this book, a bunch of guys in Poland—you probably know them as CD Projekt Red, creators of the wildly popular Witcher video games—showed up on my metaphorical doorstep and said, \"Hey, wanna make a Cyberpunk videogame?\" I looked them over and, assured that they were more than three guys in a basement with some old Apple 2's and a goat, agreed that this would be a cool idea. But that also meant that, besides doing a bit of a reset, I had to preserve what made Cyberpunk Cyberpunk, while at the same time moving the timeline forward and clearing out the deadwood. I also had to make the new version fit not just a tabletop roleplaying game but a AAA videogame title too. The result is the game you're holding in your hands. Cyberpunk RED doesn't wreck the world. But it resets many of the elements of that world without having to make it unrecognizable. The product of literally hundreds of hours of real-world research and planning, RED gives us a new arc where almost all the elements of the Cyberpunk we all love are still present, but in new forms and with some fun new twists. The mean streets of Night City are still there, but there are lots of new Players and new challenges walking the shadows. In addition, RED allows us to create something unparalleled in gaming history—a tabletop RPG that serves as the perfect onramp for the expanded and far future of the Cyberpunk 2077 arc. With threads looping forwards and back through the timeline, my partners at CDPR (Patrick, Adam, Marcin, Amelia—let's face it, the whole damned 600+ crew at the CD studio) and our crew at R. Talsorian Games have given you a deep, complex gaming experience you can explore on both the tabletop and the video screen. I didn't do this by myself either. I have to give all credit to the amazing crew here at R. Talsorian Games, James, Cody, J, Jaye, Jay, Lisa, David, and a host of other contributors who have made this thing work. We all think the result of all our hard work is a thing of beauty, and we hope you will too. Because we want you to join us in the Time of the Red and make it your time too. — Mike Pondsmith — Mike Pondsmith the guy who killed your cyberpunk character Never Fade AwayNever Fade Away 2013 (32 Years Ago)2013 (32 Years Ago) BY HUNTANG 5 He's coming out of the Hammer, about midnight, and he sees them. Three punks, mohawks bright and bristly with reflected neon, wearing high-collared jackets; gang colors. 6 NEVER FADE AWAY \"Yo! Rockerboy!\" one of them yells, \"Good show! Good noise!\" Johnny Silverhand waves absently. Fans. They're right; the gig was good. He'd rarely been better. But the show's over. They start walking towards him. One waves a bottle; the light strikes oily yellow tequila sloshing to and fro. \"Yo, Silver-rocker!\" he says. The smaller one, with the face scarred in African tribal tattoos. \"Join us! Share some! Fair price for a good gig, eh?\" The distance is closing, Johnny steers Alt, his girlfriend, to his bad side. The one without the Hand. \"Hey, Icebrothers,\" he says, noting the gang's colors and speaking in a temporizing tone. \"Your offer's solid, but it's been a long gig. I'm nearly flatlined as it is. How 'bout a replay, next night?\" By that time, they're almost on him. He lets the 9mm Federated Arms X-9 drop from the spring holster, settling into the Hand. Probably nothing, he thinks. ''Yeah. Replay next night,\" the big one says enthu- siastically, and that's when they hit him. This fast, they're a blur. The X-9 booms in the close confines of the alley; whines as spent rounds ricochet off into nowhere. There is a metallic \"snick\" as the smaller punk brings up his arm—light reflects off the fistful of razors that pretends to be a hand; then an excruciating impact lifts Johnny off the ground. Blood sprays over wet concrete. Silverhand hits with a bone wrenching impact. His pale eyes stare blankly at the sky. Alt's terrified screams recede swiftly into the dark. Sixty to zero in eight seconds flat. • • • Johnny comes to. There's something like broken glass in his guts. Red fire blots out the cool blue neon. He rolls over in a pool of something greasy. Blood. His. A cat topples off the dumpster, picking a cautious pattern around his body. No fool, this cat. A survivor. Not going to get involved. Its eyes are tiny red LEDs moving upalley; Johnny watches it. Smug bastard, he thinks. And closes his eyes. Behind his eyelids, red digitals feebly clock out his remaining moments. Bio-clock running down. Cars whispering past on the filthy, rain-wet street beyond. A Trauma Team ambulance in the distance, siren screaming. But not for him. He's checking out. He stares blankly up at the flat black ceiling of the city. Overhead, there's the shimmer of distant heat lightning interacting with the pink actinic glow of the City lights. The stars look painted in. A VTOL passes overhead, giant propblades thrashing the night. Johnny tries reaching up to it. He can see the Hand etched against the sky; slick, superchrome winking back at him. He balls the Hand that is his trademark into a chromed fist, servos clicking in one by one. He thrusts it into the gaping belly wound, gasping at the shocking pain. Somehow, he gets to his feet; staggers to the alleyway. He leans his feverish face against the cool, wet bricks. He makes a decision. He's not going to die. They're going to die. Closing his eyes, he pitches forward into the streak of passing traffic blur. Something stops him. Hands firmly grapple him, holding him up. Silverhand has just enough strength to open his eyes. There's a face looking intently at him, thin, bearded. \"Lord Almighty,\" the face says. \"They really did you, didn't they?\" Fade to black. T rauma Ward Something is screaming when Johnny wakes up. Fine. Just as long as it isn't him. He must have missed the ambulance ride to the hospital, but here in the trauma ward he can hear the sound of jet engines. That's the screaming. It mounts higher and higher, while the ward fills with warm air and the smell of ozone. From his stretcher, he can see the bulky AV-4 vehicle spin on its fans and hurtle upwards. The din dies down and he can hear screaming for real all around him; casualties of the regular firefights around the City. The doctor puts him back together. The same doctor who did his transparent Kiroshi eyes; his trademark silver hand. The same doctor who \"plugged\" him for interface and installed the software chips in the back of his skull. Johnny considers taking out a service contract. Microsurgical waldos cut through the perforated guts, swabbing, tying off, prepping. The doctor stitches in three feet of glistening wet, tank-grown intestine; plugs the punch holes with synthetic skin and muscle. Airhypos inject the area with BY ADRIAN MARC 7 NEVER FADE AWAY speeddrugs, fasthealers, endorphins and antibacte- rials. Microscopic stitches hum off the serrated teeth of a mini-closer, bonding flesh together almost as well as the original. In a month or two, there won't even be a scar. Let's hear it for newtech. The doctor's hands are quick and sure. He has done this a thousand times. He has a German accent. \"Ach... Johnny… Johnny,\" he says, over and over as he works. Over his head, the sterilizer lamps glitter like an insect's multifaceted eyes. \"Johnny... When are you going to give this up?\" says the doctor. When it ends, thinks Silverhand, from the fog of the dorphs and general anesthetics. \"Johnny,\" says the doctor sadly. Silverhand is a second son to him. His first son was Johnny's best friend. His first son was killed in an inter-Corporate war eight years ago. No man should lose more than one son in a lifetime. Thanks, thinks Johnny. I owe you one, again. His alleyway benefactor is named Thompson; a thin, reedy type, wearing an armorjack trenchcoat three sizes too large. He packs no visible hardware. But a minicam mount straddles his head like an over-sized headphone; a mike loops in front of his mouth, the camera itself coming around the right side of his skull and hardwiring into a startlingly bright-green cyber- optic. He's a Media; a one-man team of cameraman and reporter, direct feeding to some Mediacorp down- line. \"Hey, Rocker,\" he says, leaning over the table as Silverhand recovers under the sterilizer beams. \"Ready for a little vengeance?\" T he Naming of Names Johnny pulls on a red T-shirt. The shirt has the logo of his last band, Samurai. The shirt drags over the freshly stapled wound; hangs up on the bandages. He curses in Japanese. He pulls an armor jacket over his shoulders. He pulls the autoshotgun out of his bat- tered bedroom dresser, checking the load and weight. He slips it carefully into the worn under-arm holster, under the jacket. He stuffs shuriken into pockets on the outside of the jacket. He picks up the heavy S&W Handcannon and slides it into his back holster. There is a fury behind glittering pale eyes. \"So,\" he says. \"Tell me.\" 8 NEVER FADE AWAY Thompson leans back into the wall, body bracing against Johnny's intensity. He grins; takes a slug of Silverhand's tequila. \"They didn't want you. They wanted her. She's an extraction. Business as usual.\" Johnny's eyes are blank. \"No surprise\", he comments shortly. He gathers up a ragged handful of shells and begins to stuff-load the S&W's spare clip. Only the trembling of his hand—the meat hand–betrays any emotion. \"So, why'd they do me?\" he asks. \"You was home,\" grins Thompson. It's an old line. They both smile like friendly sharks. Thompson stops smiling. \"They wanted you flatlined, so it'd look like a gang job. Boostergang sees the high and mighty Mister John Silverhand out strolling with his input; decides to slash him a bit. You go down, they grab her; they're gone like vapor. Real convenient when the cops find her body in an alley 'bout a week later. They'll have motives—lots of ugly motives, but they'll be those of high-powered boosters, not pros.\" \"Pros.\" Silverhand finishes loading the second clip. He stuffs the remaining shells in the armorjack's pockets. You can never have enough ammo. \"Yeah, pros,\" repeats Thompson. \"You got shredded for fine, bro. At least a clean ten thousand Eurobucks of hardware on those boys. The speed they hit you with took maybe a seventy percent reflex boost, and those were custom rippers. The type that fold out along the fists. That sort of hardware isn't something you pick up on The Street.\" \"You saw them on me?\" Thompson's eyes are cold, slate-like. You could write anything you wanted in them. \"Get real,\" he grates. \"These were pros. If I'd jumped in, we'd both be dead.\" The eyes appraise him. \"You've been off The Street too long, Rocker. You think everyone has a nice agent, a couple Solos covering their butts, and a comfy apartment like this somewhere. I let you take it, because I knew it would take at least five minutes for you to bleed yourself dry. I waited for them to move on, then used my Trauma Card.\" There is a longish silence. Then, \"Look, Rocker. You want to guilt-loop, or you want to get your girl back?\" \"So, name names,\" says Johnny. He sits down on the edge of the bed, favoring his stapled side. He reaches out for the tequila and takes a slug. \"Good news/bad news,\" says Thompson. He's unlim- bered the cybercam unit from around his head and set it down on the table between them—the only indication of hardware is the silvermounted skull plug drilled through his right temple. The cam's cellular link through the NET is off. Thompson says, \"Good news is, it isn't one of the really big guys, like Eurobusiness Machines.\" \"Fair enough,\" says Silverhand, taking another swig from the bottle. \"Bad news is, it's Arasaka.\" \"Jesus H. Christ!\" explodes Johnny. The Hand, resting on the edge of the table, convulses. There's a rending noise and splinters fly in all directions. \"Your input was playing with hotdeck materials, Rocker. You know she ran for ITS, right?\" \"Yeah. So, you gotta work somewhere. Alt didn't talk much about her work.\" \"True. But your Alt was ITS's pet Netrunner. She moved info up and down the NET and handled their security as well. She made a lot of classy software just for them.\" Long pause. \"She built Soulkiller, you know. Or maybe you didn't. Like you said, she didn't talk much about her work.\" Johnny sits back on the couch, the bottle halfway to his lips. Even the normally disconnected Silverhand has heard of Soulkiller, the legendary black program that sucks the very soul from its Netrunner victims. Soulkiller. What a joke. Soulkiller is a memory intensive AI superroutine that can track an intruding Netrunner's cyberlink faster than a boostergang snorts drugs. It tears out the cyberpirate's brain with brutal force, recreating it in a frozen storage matrix inside the mainframe. The word is on The Street that Soulkiller may be the closest thing to Hell on Earth, and these days, that's saying a lot. And Alt made that? Johnny bites down a momentary wave of revulsion, superimposed over Alt's big green eyes, her tousled mane of hair. \"No wonder she didn't talk about her work,\" he says finally. \"I was following her, Rocker,\" says Thompson. \"Word's out that Arasaka is working on its own version of Soulkiller. Something that can walk the NET freely, getting up close and personal with people Arasaka doesn't like.\" 9 NEVER FADE AWAY \"A black-program assassin for a security company?\" Johnny is up and pacing now. He knows where this is going, and he doesn't like it. \"You probably believe in Santa Claus too,\" says Thompson, reclaiming the dregs of the bottle. \"Your Alt is the missing link. I figured they'd have to recruit her sooner or later, whether free or forced. Soulkiller's main programming is buried in her head somewhere. So, I followed her.\" \"Thanks for the concern.'' \"You don't get it, Rockerboy. I want Arasaka. I want them bad. I'll put anyone and anything on the line to get them. Even myself—if I have to broadcast this story from the grave, I'll do it. They're mine. You get in my way, you're flatlined. You go with me… \" Thompson lets it trail out. Johnny stops pacing. The room goes still. Only the Hand moves, like something alive; silver metal joints clicking, takeup reels whirring, tiny pistons shooting in and out in simulation of a pulse. The Hand turns Johnny to face the media man. It makes him say, \"How long do we have?\" Thompson smiles lopsidedly. \"How long will it take your input to rewrite Soulkiller? A day? Two?\" \"Yeah.\" Johnny turns, scoops up the keys to the Porsche. \"You chipped for a smartgun?\" he says. Thompson reaches down to his feet; draws up a long black, nylon bag. \"FN-RAL assault,\" he says, standing up. \"I was in the War. I like lead. Lots of lead.\" Rain runs down the front of the speeder. A wall of Corporate glass and steel looms to either side as they pull out into the down-town traffic. The Porsche whis- tles slightly in the chill air, its CHOOH 2 power plant throwing it against the City night. \"So where are we going, Rocker?\" says Thompson. Johnny grits his teeth. \"I've got a marker I have to pull in,\" he says. R ogue and Santiago Rogue hates the Atlantis. But she goes there because the contacts are good, and the pickings easy. Corporates looking for a fast freelance assassination. Medias and 'Runners looking to trade information. Fixers with guns, armor, and smuggling jobs. But the place has bad mem- ories. She only comes here because Santiago insists on it. \"You don't let personal caca get in the way of business,\" he says. A lot he knows. Her back is to the wall of the booth—her mirror- shaded eyes scan the room like monitor cameras. What she can't see is covered by her partner, Santiago, from the opposite side of the booth. His burly shoulders bulk the heavy armor jacket—he looks like a scowling mountain. He's not her type. But he wants her. Somehow, they've managed to work this out—the way they worked out a combat style; the division of spoils. But he keeps hoping. Stupid Nomad. Then she finds herself facing what she's dreaded for the last two years; the reason she hates this crummy bar; hates this crummy town. Johnny Silverhand walks into the Atlantis. He still has the moves, she thinks, as he strides through the big brass doors. Head held high, a cocky light in his pale glass eyes. After all this time, Rogue still can't decide whether she wants him, or just wants to kill him. He looks like he owns the place as he crosses the room towards her; a comment to an old friend here, smiling at a fan there, a narrowed glance at a potential troublemaker; then he's standing in front of her. \"Rogue,\" he says, like nothing'd ever happened. \"I need your help, Rogue.\" His voice is urgent, magnetic. \"You can go to hell,\" she replies levelly. On the other side of the booth, there's a faint sound as Santiago slides one hand over the Minami 10 in his lap. Johnny leans closer. \"Look,\" he says, \"I'm sorry. I know how you feel. And l wouldn't do this if I had any other choice.\" He pulls up a chair and straddles it, staring at her. \"Tough,\" she shoots back acidly. She hopes her voice sounds steadier than she feels. \"You owe me one,\" he says, his voice taking an edge. \"For Chicago. You owe me one at least. And it's not like I won't pay you. I've got euro.\" \"How much?\" interjects Santiago. Johnny turns to face him. \"Word on The Street is you're pulling five grand a night. I'll match and double it.\"BY NEIL BRANQUINHO 10 NEVER FADE AWAY Santiago's eyes grin in his dark face. He scratches his bristly chin with his free hand. His partner has a real mad on about this guy. But he's a Face— he's got credit; that pulls weight in Santiago's world. \"How long?\" \"Two days max. I need an extraction. And I won't haze you —it's Arasaka.\" A long pause, \"I'll understand if you think it's too much for you.\" Santiago's eyes narrow. On The Street, their team is known as the best. Who does this choob think he is? Then the Nomad realizes he's being baited. Silverhand's already figured the score between the two partners. If Santiago backs up on this, it'll be all over The Street tomorrow. If he goes with it, Rogue's going to have to back his play. Rogue's right — Silverhand is a bastard. Santiago grins. He can take this punk with one hand behind his back. \"It's going to cost you thirty thou, Rocker.\" \"Done.\" Santiago grins and raises the stakes. \"And you come with us,\" he finishes. From her side of the booth, Rogue's eyes smolder at her partner. She'd object, but the rule of the game is, \"You don't let personal caca get in the way of business.\" When Johnny pulled out his wallet, as far as Santiago was concerned, it became business. \"Done,\" says Johnny. He is reaching out across the table to match grips with the big Nomad when one long shadow falls over the table, then another. \"Ah, Mister Silverhand,\" the bigger shadow says, leaning close. Johnny can see red LED light scrolling behind his optics, forming crosshairs as he brings the smartgun up. Rogue reacts, her chipped reflexes kicking into overdrive. Her hand is a blur as it stabs up off the table, the bunched knuckles smashing the Solo's nose back into his face. He's dead before he hits the floor, but spasmed muscles tighten on the trigger of the big Malorian. There's a deafening BOOM! in a very small space, but Johnny's boosted reflexes have already thrown him up and over. There's a scream as the slug rips through the back of the booth and blows through the chest of a Corp sitting on the other side of the thin wall. Rogue's other hand fires the silenced Automag from under the table, ripping the smaller Solo in half. Santiago rolls, hitting the floor. Over by the bar, three figures in armorjackets stand up, weapons in hand. Santiago's Minami 10 hammers a short burst. The figures go flat; one staggers back into the window and falls through in a shattering sound like 11 NEVER FADE AWAY a hundred dropped chandeliers. Thompson brings up the FN-RAL with studied nonchalance, covering the two remaining, prone figures. \"Gotcha,\" he says. Johnny hits the bar floor; gun high, and eyes scan- ning the corners. Patrons keep their hands away from weapons—everyone plays cool. The disemboweled Solo on the floor whimpers. Back-to-back, the four of them edge out of the bar. R unaway \"We are seriously tagged,\" gasps Rogue as they hit the sidewalk. \"They must have tracked my Trauma Card,\" grunts Thompson. \"Guess they wanted to finish the job. You know some nice people, Rocker.\" They reach the Porsche just in time to see the shadow of an unmarked AV-4 sweep over it. Garbage, oil, and filthy water explode into steam as the jet exhausts hit the pavement. Rogue is already down, drawing a bead on the cockpit with her .44. Above her head, Santiago's Minami 10 roars in deafening staccato. The tiny red spot of her laser scope pinpoints the AV-4 pilot's forehead, even as she sees the minigun sweep around towards them. She's not going to make it. The canopy's got to be armored. She doesn't even have time to watch her life flash before her eyes. Then the laser dot is eclipsed by a screaming WHHHHHOOOOMMMMPPP! as something slams into the AV-4. The entire canopy—the entire front of the aircraft—bells out in a horrible slow-mo inferno—a rancid smell of hot metal, melted plastic, and seared flesh gusts against her as the AV tilts to one side and drunkenly impacts the street. A fireball shatters the night. \"Love those grenade launchers,\" smirks Thompson, lowering his steaming FN-RAL. \"We gotta get out of here,\" grits Johnny from behind a parked car. Rogue looks into his eyes—she can see the faint red etching of a targeting pattern flickering in their pale depths. \"Right,\" she says, already up and moving. Her breath catches ragged in her throat as they run back into the shadows. Santiago takes point; he knows all the best boltholes in the area. Thompson is next, the big FN-RAL sweep- ing their way like a flashlight. Johnny keeps his S&W close to his body; his nerves are tingling with booster effects; he's running like he's on speed. Alleyways streak by as blurs—he compensates his time sense. Rogue is covering the rear, and he can hear her breathing behind him. He says over his shoulder to the breathing dark shadow, \"I'm sorry, Rache.\" Her voice is flat, \"Never call me that,\" she says, \"Never again.\" He keeps running. \"Okay,\" he says finally, \"fair enough.\" She stops running. She says, \"Why Johnny? Why now? Couldn't you have gotten anyone else?\" She can hear him slow ahead of her. He says, \"I needed the best. And you're still the best, Rogue.\" The best. Damn him. A lt She wakes with her mouth full of cotton wool. She's smart enough to keep her eyes closed; to stifle any urge to scream. Boosterboys like it when you scream. They like it so much, they'll do anything to make you scream over and over again. Alt silently triggers commands to redline her senses to maximum. She's relieved to find herself still clothed and relatively unharmed. Not typical booster, but she won't complain. Her enhanced hearing picks up breathing nearby; the click of glasses and ice, com- puter terminals. Definitely not boosters. Alt takes a chance and opens her eyes, spits out the gag. A slender, Asian-looking man is watching her. Neat, well-tailored suit. A glass of real Scotch in one hand, which he offers towards her. \"Welcome, Ms. Cunningham\", he says, his mouth smiling and his eyes frozen. \"I am Toshiro.\" He gestures towards another man; a hulking presence lounging by the bar. \"This is Akira\", he says. Alt sits up slowly, cautiously, her boosted senses giving her clues. The comforting weight of her plastic autogun is missing. But she still has her cybered arm. \"Can I get a drink of that?\" she says, gesturing towards the glass in Toshiro's hand. \"Certainly\" he says. A gesture to Akira, and the hulk turns obediently to mix a drink. Alt is surprised at the grace of the big man's hands. He moves like an athlete. He moves like a professional killer. Akira brings her the drink, and Alt doesn't even think about making a break for it. 12 NEVER FADE AWAY \"Thanks.\" The drink cools the pounding flame in her head. \"Certainly. It is the least we can do for a promising new associate.\" Bingo! she thinks. She's been grabbed by Corporate headhunters. Fine. Great. She can deal with it. Just learn the rules, play the game, and go to work. After a week, it'll be just like checking into work at the ITS offices. \"So... \" she says cautiously. \"What kind of work do you have lined up for your new... um... employee?\" Toshiro leans forward, setting the drink down. \"So.\" He says, smiling, \"Ms. Cunningham. I wish for you to tell me all about the program you call... Soulkiller.\" Her blood freezes like a silenced scream. A Gathering of hosts Johnny, Santiago, Thompson, and Rogue. They are perched two hundred feet in the air on a rusting fire escape. From their vantage point on the blackened brick side of the old MarLux Hotel they can see ten blocks in any direction. Rogue's eyes are switched to infrared, scanning for AVs and airogyros. Johnny is watching the street below. Thompson is scanning the radio chatter and Santiago is talking. \"We go in,\" he says. It's been two hours since the firefight. \"Fair enough, \" replies Rogue. \"But we do it ASAP.\" Santiago grins, \"You got a reason?\" \"Getting shot at always pisses me off,\" she grins back. \"Besides, I figure they're combing The Street right now, looking for us. They'll expect us to be trying to ditch them— they'll be putting their best out to find us. Meanwhile, the second stringers are guarding the offices.\" \"How you figure they're holding her in the Arasaka office complex?\" says Johnny. The Hand is in standby mode, running a test routine. Servos click and whir and silver fingers spasm and flex of their own voli- tion. Thompson speaks up. \"Makes sense. The only mainframe big enough to run Soulkiller is in the main Arasaka building. Either that, or in Tokyo. We're not a big enough problem to rate flying her all the way back to Japan.\" \"Thanks.\" \"So this means we've gotta punch into the main offices of the most rabidly paranoid security company in the universe.\" considers Santiago. \"Homeboy, you pick some great places to lose your women.\" \"Stuff it,\" cuts in Rogue. \"Here's the plan.\" I nterface the Music Headfirst in the NET, Alt weaves magic. They've studded her into the Arasaka mainframe, given her room to run, hemmed in only by three Arasaka Netrunners who watch her every move. Her body lies comatose on a contour couch, linked by cables to a cybermodem. She's pulling down sub- routines, crunching the compilers, getting comfy with the CPUs. From memory and notes, she's recreating Soulkiller, the eater of minds. Soulkiller is a stationary program, locked to a part of the system architecture. The challenge Toshiro has given her is to give it movement—the ability to navi- gate the NET on its own. It's a subtle problem—navigation data and deci- sion subroutines take up a huge amount of memory; the reason free roaming programs are so limited in scope. Soulkiller already eats a lot of megabytes; to make it free running will take more memory than any normal computer can handle. The problem excites her professionalism even as the creation revolts her humanity. God, they know her so well. The original Soulkiller started as a matrix to contain artificial personalities. She'd studied the concept, worked out the parameters for creating a storage matrix. She'd been fascinated and awed to discover that the same matrix could contain living engrams; transfer them from computer to body and even back again. It was immortality. ITS had taken it from her to build a killer. And she hadn't known how to stop them. 13 NEVER FADE AWAY Now Alt looks over her options. If she doesn't build Arasaka's monster, they'll torture or kill her. If she builds their horror, they'll keep her alive. But. But once it's built, they'll put her into it. W ar Party A plan hinges on strange elements. Rogue leaves their motel bolthole at nine. She moves fast, travels light, moving from place to place. Here, she picks up five pounds of plastic explosives; there, flash-bombs, timers and tripwires. Santiago covers her. He picks up more explosives, a combat assault cyberdeck, and a long, bulky black sniper rifle. Johnny's on the cellular, working the connections. He pulls his bandmates in from around the City, care- fully dodging the phone taps, shadowers, and snoops. He sets the time and place and the gig is on. Thompson is on The Street, working hard. A phone call here, a tip to the screamsheets there. A Fixer picks up a little euro on the side, and passes the word down. By 10 a.m., The Street knows there's going to be a party. By noon, the word is all over The Street—the band is Samurai, the time is sundown, and the Smash is free. By one, The Street knows the party is going to be on the edge of town at Industrial Park. Arasaka's twenty two story office compound faces Industrial Park. Like a single, hungry thing, the mob converges. Sorceror's Apprentice 7 :29 p.m. The twisting construct spins, a blazing pillar of white fire, sparkshowers of stars. A glowing DNA chain, a whirling dervish takes shape and form, in the construct reality of the interface, towering above her, looming like fear itself. Dazzling, it exudes the pal- pable scent of terror. It speaks in a voice like crystal, and momentarily Alt's breath is taken by its perfect, murderous beauty. \"I am.\" it sings triumphantly to the cold stars. \"I am your Controller.\" Alt replies. \"You will follow my commands.\" A slight hesitation in her voice. \"As always,\" it says, as though doubt had never existed in the universe. \"What is your bidding, Mistress?\" Alt lets out a long, exhausted breath. She's gotten the Controller override past her watchdogs. Now she has a chance. \"This is what I want you to do,\" she begins P arty Hard P ar t y f H ar d P ar t y f H ar d P ar t y f H ar d Seicho Harada is second in command of Security for the Arasaka complex at Industrial Park. Seicho is afraid. Since early afternoon, the people have been pouring into the large, grassy park opposite his guard position; at first a trickle, then a stream, then a torrent. He can't figure it out. They don't do things like this in Tokyo. In Tokyo, people are consistent. They make sense. Here, people are animals. He thinks about calling the City Cops, but that would reflect badly on Arasaka. The world's largest security Corporation calling for help? What a loss of face. But there are six thousand people crammed into the tableau in front of him. Up on the makeshift stage, acting as though invulnerable, struts Johnny Silverhand, working the crowd up. Seicho wants him. He wants him dead. But Silverhand might as well be on Luna as far as Arasaka is concerned. A single gunshot could trigger a riot of unbelievable proportions. Seicho can feel the tension building. So can Johnny. An invisible thread binds them as adversaries, eye to eye over a battlefield of unwitting bodies. Can you feel it Can you touch it Get ready cause here we go Can you feel it Can you touch it Get ready cause here we go My soul inserted with vital force Won't spare what I'm hunting for It's the animal in my blood Wouldn't stop it even if I couldBY NEIL BRANQUINHO 14 NEVER FADE AWAY Johnny smiles. He's got them, so far. The crowd is paranoid—they expect to be thrown out at any minute. He's been pumping them for the last hour with chro- matic and metal rock, getting them edgy and irritable; in a party mood to scream and shout, kick some tail. The first uniformed idiot who interrupts their party is going to get himself hosed. Seed is sown—I'm chippin' in Roll the bones—I'm chippin' in Embed that code—I'm chippin' in Mayhem flows Not backing down, never backing down Not backing down, yeah It's like driving the freeway at two hundred miles per hour. The crowd swells and breathes as the first verse goes down, taking on the cohesiveness of a living thing. The bass player picks up the back beat and the two of them slam into the next turn of the song, dragging the crowd with them. Can you feel it Can you touch it Get ready cause here we go Can you feel it Can you touch it Get ready cause here we go Johnny's eyes scan the perimeter of the park. To one edge, he can see Santiago in position on the rooftop opposite of the Arasaka complex. Deep in the crowd, Thompson and Rogue are poised, ready to make the break. All he has to do is give them the chance; the diversion. All he has to do is turn around and lead six thou- sand people right into a wall of weapons. Suits run when I come undone Can't kill me I'm zeroes and ones Add justice to the people's math Blaze way down the rebel path Hear my call—I'm chippin' in Total war—I'm chippin' in Casings fall—I'm chippin' in Kill them all Not backing down, never backing down Can you feel it Can you touch it Get ready cause here we go Can you feel it Can you touch it Get ready cause here we go, yeah The moment freezes, hanging in air like a death. Punching his battered Telestrater over to \"remote\", Johnny leaps off the stage, pushing his way through the crowd. His voice holds solid over the radio mike; powerful, pleading, entreating, seducing, and the huge crowd turns with him; surges around him, swallows him. Its knife edge balanced—six thousand people teetering on the edge, chanting, singing. At 15 NEVER FADE AWAY the perimeter of the park, Arasaka police stand guard nervously, their eyes riveted on the mob. Silverhand starts towards them, and they choke on the deci- sion—twenty guards facing down a wall of humanity, centered on one man whose voice holds them, binds them. An assault rifle comes up, and the crowd, like an irritable dog, notices the small army facing them down. The scene is set; the guards distracted, and on the rooftop, Santiago takes aim... Then it goes wrong. One of the faceless guards loses his nerve. The staccato sound of gunfire splits the air. But Johnny is already gone, faded back into a mob that howls like a wounded thing, then surges forward, shattering like surf against armored bodies, lobby doors, massed vehicles, guns. Screams. Gunfire. The strobe flash of the mob tearing a guard apart with vampyre teeth, and ripper claws. The sound of a sniper rifle high above the melee, as Santiago methodically picks out guards and blows them away with his Nomad Long Rifle. The lobby doors explode inwards as six thousand bodies slam against them. Rogue is already in—in when Santiago took out the pair of guards by the main doors. She's on the floor and rolling, a fast dazzle bomb palmed over the top of the security desk to fry the optics of the monitor team, followed by a frag grenade a second later. The deafening explosion goes unnoticed in the typhoon roar of the mob. Thompson's right behind her, his video rig and FN-RAL sweeping everything in his path. Both wear armor jacks with the colors of the infamous Iron Sights boostergang, a known Arasaka hit group. Rogue skids around the corner towards the eleva- tor bank, moments ahead of the crowd. Rapidly, she opens each car, spray paints the monitor lens, punches a destination, then ducks out. The last car in line, she places a shaped charge explosive on the ceiling, wired to a microtransmitter. This one she sends to the twenty-second floor; the executive office suites. Then the rampaging mob hits and carries her along in the swell. Thompson is waiting for her by the stairwell. Moments later, Johnny shows up wearing an Arasaka company jacket he's pulled off a guard's body. The name tag reads Harada. O ptions Akira turns from the security board. \"It has started,\" he announces. \"Instructions, Toshiro-sama?\" Toshiro considers. It was a masterstroke for Silverhand to raise a literal army of fans against him. Toshiro is check-mated—Arasaka cannot gun down the crowd with impunity. But he does have options. He turns to Akira. \"Send teams to the elevators. Guard the top and bottom of the stairwells, and kill anything in the elevator cars.\" He looks over at Alt's dormant form. \"We have the program,\" he says. \"If we do not have her body, there is no evidence.\" Seemingly oblivious, the plugged in Alt permits herself a brief smile. A lot he knows. • • • Elevators chime open on floors ten, eighteen and five. The fire teams on ten and eighteen throw a hail of lead through the doors. The elevators are empty. The team on five is warned, and opens the doors with greater caution. Empty. \"It's a trick!\" shouts the team leader. \"To the stairwell!\" On floor six, a panting Johnny and Thompson reach the stairwell landing, crack open the fire doors and scout the hall. They can hear other doors slamming open as the fire teams converge; they bolt for the elevator bank. Prying the doors open, they can see the top of the car on floor five. They drop down to its top. Thompson hotwires the motor, and they start up. Rogue can hear running feet behind her. She pauses from her vantage point on floor seven and fires a quick burst down the stairwell. How much time? she thinks. She judges the breathing and the heavy booted tread, and punches six seconds on the timer, then rolls out of the seventh floor fire door. She is halfway down the hall when the first of the charges go off, collapsing the stairwell in on itself and burying the pursuing fire teams. Jamming open the elevator doors with her gun butt, she drops down onto the rising car. • • • \"Hold her'', says Toshiro. Dimly, through the interface, Alt can feel Akira's hands pressing her into the seat. She struggles as the techs strip her plug guards off and hold her wrists. \"Can the program be run?\" Toshiro 16 NEVER FADE AWAY demands. His Netrunners nod. Helpless in the grip of the interface, Alt can only sense Toshiro jacking himself into the cyberdeck, giving the command to RUN. Then her mind is ripped away. • • • The elevator streaks upwards, the shaft echoing to either side. They can hear explosions; the sound of running feet, the hammer of machine gun fire. They pass the burned out husks of the cars on floors ten and eighteen. At the twentieth floor, the elevator starts to slow. Just above them, they can see the bottom of the express elevator on the twenty second. \"Duck and cover!\" yells Rogue. She taps the trans- mitter button on her collar and the world blows up. A ngel Heaven She floats naked in a sea of stars. Around her swirls the matrix of Soulkiller, towering into measureless space. Alt reaches out with her enhanced mentality, shaping and forming. A brief flare of thought, and Soulkiller sucks away the minds of her three guardian Netrunners, letting their bodies drop. From the mind of the head Netrunner, she pulls out the access codes to the mainframe's inner levels. She strips the memory of data, downloading it to her hidden files throughout the NET. Twenty million dollars vanishes from Accounting, to reappear in a subaccount under her name. Pulling Toshiro's signature from his checking account file, she signs his name with a flourish. Using the access codes, she activates the room monitor. She can see the three Netrunners slumped senseless in their chairs; her own unconscious body limply sprawled across the central console. Akira moves towards it. Alt triggers the room lasers and cuts him in two; his body hits the floor with a steaming thud. Toshiro's eyes widen in shock, then narrow as he realizes what has happened. \"Congratulations, Ms. Cunningham,\" he says with mock formality. \"It seems you have found a way to escape your demise.\" \"You zaibatsu bastard,\" she says through the interface, a tiny voice in his ear. \"You're going to sit right here with your hands on the table, where I can watch them. You move, and you're laser meat.\" She tracks the defense system onto him, locking it to fire at the slightest position change. Then she turns back into the Soulkiller construct, wrapping its power around her, gathering herself to transfer back into her body. The room staggers; lurches, as five pounds of plastique explosive slams through the ceiling of the elevator, creating an instant fireball. The lasers go wild; spilling a maze of ruby light in every direction. Toshiro throws himself flat, toppling the cyberdeck and breaking Alt's connections. She flails wildly with the Construct—too little, too late. Three figures burst into the room, smartguns laying down a pattern of fire through the maelstrom. IR sup- pressed, enhanced vision on, Johnny spots Alt's still form slumped over a contour couch. He bends down to her, taking her in his arms, trembling. Across the room, Rogue looks away. \"Well, well, well,\" says Thompson, striding across the wrecked room towards the Corporate head. \"What do we have here? Looks like kidnapping and maybe murder. They're going to put you away for a long, long time, Toshiro-chan.\" His green cyberoptic winks bright as he transmits live and direct to his news net; his head swivels right to left with practiced ease as he subvocalizes the opening to his story; the story he will use to break Arasaka in Night City. Johnny stares a long time at Alt's almost lifeless body. There is a feeble pulse. But Alt—Alt is gone; lost in the machine; trapped behind crystal. Lost forever. Gone. He stands away from the couch. \"Cut transmission, \" he says to Thompson. The green cyberoptic goes dark. Silverhand's own eyes are featureless white marbles. The Hand convulses in fury by his side, locking onto the S&W in its lowslung hip rig. The metal fingers lock to the butt, scrabble-clicking along the parkerized grip. He just doesn't care anymore. He's dead inside. To hell with it. Silverhand raises the big black gun. A red pinpoint centers on Toshiro's forehead. \"Bang.\" says Johnny. The Hand convulses. \"Bang\" says the gun. Silverhand turns to gather up her still warm body in his arms. Behind the wall of monitors, a disembodied Alt screams to him. But he can't hear her as he walks away.

(ascap) 1718 VIEW FROM THE EDGE So, you wanna be a Cyberpunk? or maybe juSt look like one? Before you pitch off your sleepmat and jump in, there's a few things we need to tell you. First of all, the name. Cyberpunk comes from two words. Cyber—from the term cybernetic, or a fusion of flesh and machine technology. Punk—from an early 1980s rock music style that epitomized violence, rebel- lion, and social action in a nihilistic way. The term was popularized in the Pre-Collapse days by a group of writers who specialized in writing science fiction with this kind of techno-mélange. Their works featured a streamlined blend of rock, pop, sex, drugs, and the highest, hippest technology—usually grafted onto your body somewhere. The archetypal cyberpunk heroes of the 80s, ranged from techno-barbarians roaming a Post-holocaust world, to cyber-chipped jet-setters with designer bodies. Of course, from our enlightened viewpoint here in the Time of the Red, this all looks pretty dated. After all, you probably accessed this article from your Agent. You used a Kamakura 19 interface cable with a direct link from your Interface Plugs. You're used to hardwiring into appliances to make coffee, \"studding\" into the ‘Benz to drive down to the corner store. But understand—in 1987, this was all considered visionary stuff. No one had plugs. You couldn't dial anyone on your Agent. Designer drugs were illegal. You could walk down most city streets without an armor jacket. There wasn't even a NET. Not that there is anymore, but they didn't even have the idea back then.

History books can tell you in detail about the Crash of 1994, when the Euro-Combines established the World Stock Exchange, and the economies of the United States and Old Soviet Russia collapsed. In those days, both ranked as superpowers, instead of a couple of over-armed second-raters waving nuclear weapons around under the watchful eye of the EuroSpace Defense Agency. So far, the Tycho mass- drivers are still ready to throw rocks at Moscow and Washington, so we'll probably avoid having the nuclear war everyone's been expecting since 1944. After all, rocks are cheap. And so far, the Corps have only used one nuke. T he 4th Corporate War Now, of course, a couple years back, everything was more-or-less run by the Corporations, which were pretty much governments themselves. But then, there was a huge and very ugly war between two of the biggest Megacorps—Arasaka Security and Militech Arms—that ended with one of the sides popping off a pocket nuke in the middle of downtown Night City. You can see how that ended up. W hat We Miss For all the wartime uglies, you can still go anywhere on one passport: one-worldism at its best. After all, with borders shattering and the world governments in constant flux, who's gonna stop you? The remaining currencies are stabilized to each other, and the Eurodollar is still the world currency.

Sure, it isn't the best life, what with the boostergangs roaming the Volumetric and the major-league crime problems, but it beats actu- ally being on The Street. At least the mega-arcologies have cops (okay, rented Corporate cops, but it's easier than fronting the euro for your own personal Solo!). Besides, the media-nets make sure that every apartment has direct cable access to TV, radio, and sensory feed, so there's always something to do on a Saturday night. Where were we? Oh yeah—you wanted to be a Cyberpunk. C loser than they thought Here's more background for you to think over. When the grand old Masters of the Movement first started writing the cyberpunk genre, they assumed that most of the things they wrote about would either never happen or would happen in the far future. No one knew that the West Germans were already developing \"organic\" circuitry in the late 1980s, or that the United States Air Force was developing mentally controlled weapons systems. Synthetic myomar muscle fibers were just starting to be used to control prosthetic devices, and very few people could project ahead into the 1990s when organic chipped arms and legs would be possible. There were a few primitive experiments with bio-engi- neering—things like Frostban™ and a few new types of corn—nothing like the bio-engineered animals that we used to (unsuccessfully) terraform the Martian colonies. It took about fifteen years for the new-tech to catch up with the vision. First, the military started using cybertech- nology to create \"perfect soldiers\" and pilots. Some of the spin-off led to prosthetic limbs, eyes, and other body parts. Organic circuitry led to direct hookups between humans and computers. Combined with advanced telecommunications technology and satellite down-links, the basis for the once planet-wide NET (now wrecked thanks to the War and the R.A.B.I.D.S.), was established. As each new technological advancement slammed into place, a sort of cultural technoshock set in. want to know about transportation? skip to page 322 want to know about having fun? skip to page 329 want to know about food? skip to page 328 want to know about drugs? skip to page 227 21 VIEW FROM THE EDGE T echnoshock Technoshock: When technology outstrips people's ability to comprehend or fit it into their lives. Suddenly, people freak out. They get irrational; violent. Families shatter; relationships tear apart. People feel helpless in the face of the Universe. Eventually, the whole society grinds to a halt, the victim of a mass psychosis. That's what we now call the Collapse. There were three major responses to technoshock. Most people, their lives uprooted and changed by the advancements, sat passively waiting for their leaders to tell them what to do next. One smaller group tried to turn back the clock, founding the basis for what we call the Neo-Luddite movement. The remaining group—they decided to hit the future head on. With the old 1980's visionary writings as their guide, they established the movement we now call Cyberpunk. W elcome to the dark Future Okay, so now you're ready. As a Cyberpunk, you grab technology by the throat and hang on. You're not afraid to \"0 out\" the newest in \"enhancements,\" cybertech and bioengineering. You've got interface plugs in your wrists, weapons in your arms, lasers in your eyes, and biochip programs in your brain. You become the car you drive, the aerodyne you fly, the guns you shoot. You dive headfirst into computer systems, using your mind to hurtle at lightspeed down the rabbit holes of NET Architectures. With cyborg-fingers you pick computer locks; with enhanced senses, you see into the Future. Cyberpunk is also an attitude. You wear the most \"in\" clothes, know the right people, and follow the right crowds. You plan your crimes in the most select clubs and bars; your enemies are Corporate armies, cyborg biker gangs, power-armored assassins, and comput- er-wired Netrunners.

This is just a structured form of make-believe play acting, rather like when you played Cops & Robbers (or Rebels and Empire) as a kid.

Well, let's show you. ▶A Typical Roleplaying Session ◀ Mike, Bruce, Dave, and Lisa have gath- ered together for a roleplaying session (also known as a \"run\"). They find a com- fortable place in Mike's living room with enough space for some books, some dice, and a few favorite types of party food (a staple of a good roleplaying session). As Gamemaster, Mike starts off the session by proposing the situation and describing the scene. He begins: \"The three of you have just entered Night City. It's about nine at night, and the dark, windy urban streets are slick with the recent rain and the filth of years of slum living. Weak moonlight casts long shadows as you make your way past street beggars and the occa- sional boosterganger looking for an easy target. Bruce has decided to play the role of a Solo, a tough mercenary named Gron Helstrom. He thinks about the type of Character he is playing and decides that someone like Gron would be looking for action. He says, \"Gron grabs the nearest street thug by the lapels of his cheap outfit and growls, ‘Where's the nearest bar?'\" Dave has decided to play the role of a Lawman: Jord Mattersly, a clever would-be detective and delver into mys- teries—the more bizarre the better. Jord's a thinker, not a fighter—so Dave tries another tack: \"Jord pulls Gron's hands off the thug's collar and says, ‘Excuse my friend's enthusiasm. We're just looking for a place with strong drink and some quiet socializing...'\" Lisa is playing the role of Spyder, a cunning Netrunner/Hacker thief with a bit of Robin Hood in her background. As a natural paranoiac, she's scanning the locals around the group. \"What does Spyder see in the crowd?\" As GM, Mike thinks about it. It's night, in a bad section of town, and Gron's just roughed up one of the locals. He says, \"Well, Spyder sees three large figures moving silently out of the shadows. The moonlight glints off drawn weapons and cyberware as they approach you...\" Lisa thinks about it, then says, \"Can I use my Interface Ability to take control of any local automated defenses?\" Mike responds, \"It will take time to scan for something and then you have to break in. The boosters are coming on fast.\" \"Spyder turns to Gron and Jord,\" says Lisa, catching on fast. There isn't going to be an easy way out of this one. Gron's just gotten them tagged on The Street and there's going to be blood tonight. \"Hey people, we have a problem coming up...\" GaminG Keywords Action: Something a Charac t er do e s t o understand, or manip- ulate themselves or the world around them.

It's the most demanding position in terms of energy and imagination, a lot like directing a film when you can't control all the actors. But it can be immensely satisfying as well. The GM uses the background of the game world to devise plots into which they place the Players' Characters (or uses published adventures, several of which are included in this book). They describe the situation to the Players as their Characters would know it, and the Players describe what their Characters are doing to respond to the situation. The plot generally flows from there, with the GM presenting obstacles, NPCs, and other elements in story form as the Players continually decide what their Characters will do. And so, the Players and GM create a story together. ▶ How Do I GM? ◀ The best way is through trying it yourself. We have provided some examples of how to incorporate rules into gameplay in the many sidebars throughout this rule book. The most important part is to be a good storyteller—to try to vividly describe the world you are guiding people through, and to pose problems or situations that challenge your Players. Challenge them, but don't squash them. Almost as import- ant is the need for the GM to be an impar- tial judge of the rules and effects of the game on their Players. Remember: if you aren't interesting and you aren't fair, no one's going to want to star in your \"movie.\" Good luck! how Do the Rules Fit in? Many situations come up during a game that require more than common sense to resolve. For example, if you've never been in a firefight, it might be hard to judge how one would go. The rules give you a way to play out those situations in a fair and whAt is A ChARACteR? Most of you are going to use these rules to play Characters (aka Player Characters or PCs), personas you control who exist in this fictional universe of 2045. This book is set up to give you a clear idea of how your Characters think and act and how they work within the rules. A Character is a role that you will be playing in the loose, impromptu play that makes up a roleplaying session. For example, if your roleplaying group were staging a recreation of the movie Blade Runner, Rick Deckard would be one of the Characters. Much like Harrison Ford, the person playing Rick in this adventure would try to act out what they thought the Character would be doing in each scene of the \"movie.\" ▶ Do I Have to Dress Up? ◀ Not really. Although there is a specific style of roleplaying game called a LARP (or Live Action Role Play, where people do dress up), most games are played by sitting around a table, imagining the scene described by the GM, and then acting out what you think your Character would do in that situation. You don't have to dress in costume, wave around plastic weapons or (God help us!) run around in the steam tunnels at midnight. In fact, one of the best games we've ever heard about was played by a bunch of U.S. Army guys stuck in a slit trench in Iraq. Yeah, you could say they were dressed appropriately (guns, gear, armor) but you won't have to go that far. whAt is the GAmemAsteR? One of you will take on the role of the Gamemaster (or Referee): the person who presents the story to the Players, controls any Characters not controlled by the Players (called Non-Player Characters or NPCs), and applies and arbitrates the GaminG Keywords Mission: A scenario with a defined objective run by the GM and played by the PCs.

XdY: A way the game uses to tell you how many of what type of die to roll. For example, 1d6 means you should roll a single d6. 24 VIEW FROM THE EDGE consistent manner. When the outcome of an event is in question, you roll dice (Cyberpunk RED uses ten- sided (d10s) and six-sided dice (d6s), and the result of the roll helps you determine what happens. Then the GM generally applies the rules and results as required. Okay, that should give you a handle on the basic concepts; now get on with the game!

BY EVE VENTRUE The Cyberpunk world is a violent, dangerous place filled with people who'd love to rip your arms off and eat them. The traditional concepts of good and evil have been replaced by the values of expedience: you do what you have to survive. soul and the new machinesoul and the new machine who will you be?who will you be? 2728 SOUL AND THE NEW MACHINE N ew Time, Bad Time, Red time This is especially true in the Time of the Red, when a massive war between Megacorporations and an atomic bombing have ravaged what little vestiges of civilization would be familiar to people in society today. I t's always personal The rule is it's always personal. Survival is a personal thing and the hallmark of these dark times. But there's a wider aspect to that—you look to your friends, team, family, or clan first. If you can do some good along the way, great. But don't count on it. Cyberpunk Characters are survivors in a tough, grim world, faced with life-and-death choices. How they make these choices has a lot to do with whether they end up as vicious animals roaming a ruined world or retain something of their basic humanity. Cyberpunk Characters are the heroes of a bad situation, working to make it better (or at least survivable) whenever they can. Whether it takes committing crimes, defying authority, or even outright revolution, the quintessential Cyberpunk Character is a rebel with a cause. A s a cyberpunk player As a Cyberpunk roleplayer, it's up to you to find that cause and go to the wall with it. This is the essence of Cyberpunk—playing your Character with the proper disaffected, cynical-yet-idealistic style. Whether you're a biker with leathered skin and metal claws, or a debu- tante in satin sporting the latest in designer cyberoptics, you're going to need a certain panache—a certain flair—in portraying yourself. To achieve the essence of the 2000s, you need to master three concepts: #1 style oveR substAnCe It doesn't matter how well you do something, as long as you look good doing it. If you're going to blow it, make sure you look like you planned it that way. Normally, clothes and looks don't matter in an adven- ture—in this world, having a leather armor jacket and mirrorshades is a serious consideration. #2 AttituDe is eveRythinG It's truth. Think dangerous; be dangerous. Think weak; be weak. Remember, everyone in the 2000s carries lots of lethal hardware. Each Character in this world is playing a Role—a face that person projects to the outside world as the real thing. They won't be impressed by your new Militech smartgun unless you swagger into the club looking like you know how to use it...and are just itching for an excuse. Never walk into a room when you can stride in. Never look at someone unless you can make it your best \"killer\" look. Use your best \"I'm bad and you aren't\" smile. Don't sit around the flat or cube waiting for the next job. Get on out and hit the clubs and hangouts. Make sure you're where the party starts. #3 live on the eDGe The Edge is that nebulous zone where risk-takers and high rollers go. On the Edge, you'll risk your cash, your rep, even your life on something as vague as a principle or a big score. As a Cyberpunk, you want to be the action, start the rebellion, light the fire. Join great causes and fight for big issues. Never drive slow when you can drive fast. Throw yourself up against danger and take it head on. Never play it too safe. Stay committed to the Edge. the Rules:the Rules: #1 style #1 style overover substAnCe. substAnCe. #2 AttituDe is #2 AttituDe is everythingeverything. . #3 live on the #3 live on the edgeedge. . #4 #4 breakbreak the the rulesrules.. — Ripperjack— RipperjackBY RICHARD BAGNALL 29 SOUL AND THE NEW MACHINE R oles the core of cyberpunk roleplaying Even after a massive war between Megacorporations followed by an atomic bombing, the world of Cyberpunk is a combination of savage, sophisticated, modern, and retrograde. Fashion-model beautiful Rockerboys rub shoulders with battle-armored road warriors, all of them making the scene in the hottest dance clubs, sleaziest bars, and meanest streets this side of the post-holocaust. And every single one of them has a Role: an occupation they are known by on The Street. There are ten Roles in the Cyberpunk RED future: Rockerboys, Solos, Netrunners, Techs, Medtechs, Medias, Execs, Lawmen, Fixers, and Nomads. RoCkeRboys Rock-and-roll rebels who use performance, art, and rhetoric to fight authority. solos Assassins, bodyguards, killers, and soldiers-for-hire in a lawless new world. netRunneRs Cybernetic master hackers of the post-NET world and brain-burning secret stealers. teChs Renegade mechanics and supertech inventors; the people who make the Dark Future run. meDteChs Unsanctioned street doctors and cyberware medics, patching up meat and metal alike. meDiAs Reporters, media stars, and social influencers risking it all for the truth—or glory. exeCs Corporate power brokers and business raiders fight- ing to restore the rule of the Megacorps. lAwmen Maximum law enforcers patrolling the mean streets and barbarian warrior highways beyond. FixeRs Dealmakers, organizers, and information brokers in the post-War Midnight Markets of The Street. nomADs Transport experts, ultimate road warriors, pirates, and smugglers who keep the world connected. R ole Abilities Each role will give you access to a Role Ability which will help you navigate the streets of the Dark Future. We'll talk more about these abilities in the Role Ability section (pg. 142) but for now you can mark down the name of your chosen Role Ability and note that it starts with a value of 4, which represents the years you've spent on the streets already. 30 ROCKERBOY If you live to rock, this is where you belong. As a Rockerboy, you're one of the street poets, the social conscience, and the rebels of the Time of the Red. With the advent of digital porta-studios and garage music mastering, every Rockerboy with a message can take it to The Street, put it in the record stores, bounce it off the comsats. Sometimes, your message isn't something the Corporations or the government wants to hear. Sometimes what you say is going to get right in the faces of the powerful people who really want to run this world. But you don't care, because as a Rockerboy, you know it's your place to challenge authority, whether in straight-out protest songs that tell it like it is, playing kick-ass rock n' roll to get the people away from the TV sets and into The Streets, firing up the crowd with speeches, or composing fiery writings that shape the minds and hearts of millions. You have a proud history as a Rockerboy. Dylan, Springsteen, U2, NWA, the Who, Jett, the Stones—the legions of hard-rock heroes who told the truth with screaming guitars or gut-honest lyrics. You have the power to get the people up; to lead, inspire, and inform. Your message can give the timid courage, the weak strength, and the blind vision. Rockerboy legends like Johnny Silverhand, Rockerboy Manson (for whom the Role is named) and Kerry Eurodyne have led armies against Corporations and govern- ments. Rockerboys have exposed corruption and brought down dictators. It's a lot of power for someone doing gigs every night in another city. But you can handle it. After all: you came to play! ▶ Role Ability: ChARismAtiC imPACt The Rockerboy's Role Ability is Charismatic Impact. With this ability, they can influence others by sheer presence of personality. They need not be a musical performer; they can influence others through poetry, art, dance, or simply their physical presence. They could be a rocker—or a cult leader. As they grow in skill, they can affect larger and larger groups and call on their fans for greater and greater requests of loyalty (Go to pg. 144 for details). \"my olD mAn \"my olD mAn triedtried to Do musiC bACk beFoRe the wAR. the CoRPs snAPPeD to Do musiC bACk beFoRe the wAR. the CoRPs snAPPeD him uP, suCkeD him DRy, AnD sPit him out to him uP, suCkeD him DRy, AnD sPit him out to diedie on the stReet. these on the stReet. these DAys, it's DiFFeRent. i wRite my DAys, it's DiFFeRent. i wRite my ownown lyRiCs, mAke my lyRiCs, mAke my ownown ARRAnGements, ARRAnGements, ReCoRD it All myselF, then uPloAD it to the DAtA Pool. no CoRP neeDeD.

Whether as a freelance guard and killer-for-hire, or as one of the Corporate cybersoldiers who enforce business deals and the Company's \"black operations,\" you're one of the elite fighting machines of the Time of the Red. Most Solos put in military time during the 4th Corporate War, in a Corporate army, or in one of the government's current \"police actions\" around the country. As the battle damage piles up, you start to rely more and more upon tech: cyberlimbs for weapons and armor, bio-program chips to increase your reflexes and awareness, combat drugs to give you that edge over your opponents. When you're the best of the best, you might even leave the ranks of Corporate samurai and go ronin—freelanc- ing your lethal talents as a killer, bodyguard, or enforcer to whoever can pay your very high fees. Sounds good? There's a price—a heavy one. You've lost so much of your original meat body that you're almost a machine. Your killing reflexes are so jacked up that you have to restrain yourself from going berserk at any moment. Years of combat drugs taken to keep the edge have given you terrifying addictions. There are few people you can trust anymore. One night you might sleep in a penthouse condo in the City, the next in a filthy alley on The Street. But that's the price of being the best. And you're willing to pay it. Because you're a Solo. ▶ Role Ability: CombAt AwAReness The Solo's Role Ability is Combat Awareness. With Combat Awareness, a Solo can call up their training to have an enhanced situational awareness of the battlefield. When combat begins, anytime outside of combat, or in combat with an Action, a Solo may divide the total number of points they have in their Combat Awareness Role Ability among a number of combat abilities. If a Solo chooses to not change their point assignments, their previous ones persist. Activating some of these abilities will cost the Solo more points than others (Go to pg. 146 for details). \"why'D i Join uP? i wAs tiReD oF beinG \"why'D i Join uP? i wAs tiReD oF beinG hungryhungry AnD AnD poorpoor. when militeCh oFFeReD . when militeCh oFFeReD me thRee squARes A DAy AnD A Cot, you betteR believe i siGneD uP. the FiRst Few me thRee squARes A DAy AnD A Cot, you betteR believe i siGneD uP. the FiRst Few ACtions weRen't bAD. the thiRD one went PeAR shAPeD.

At three, your parents bought you an old Kirama LPD-12 cyberdeck with Zetatech 526 optical goggles (you were too young for interface plugs), and your life was changed. By fifth grade, you were already using REFRAME-G1s meta-programming to crack into the school district's system and change your grades. When you were thirteen, you shifted enough funds out of unprotected Trans United Bank accounts to finance your first neural interface plugs. You couldn't wait to run high and fast with the other gods of the NET—Bartmoss, Magnificent Curtis, and the rest. Then the 4th Corp War blew the Old NET apart. The R.A.B.I.D.S. made NET travel a suicide run; the Nodes were fragmented or cor- rupted. But there were still places to run. You just had to go there and jack in the hard way. You traded in sitting on the couch for a Bodyweight combat bodysuit and Virtuality 5 interface goggles to mesh NET with Meatspace. The systems you cracked were smaller, but even deadlier. Now, you're really part of a team, with Solos to cover your back, Medtechs to restart your heart if the ICE gets you, and Techs to help you hot-wire your cyber- deck for more speed and software deployment. Now, nothing can stop you. As an electronic wraith, you slip into the \"hardest\" mainframe systems with ease: stealing, trading, and selling their deepest secrets at will. The Black ICE may still kill you in the end, but until the ride runs out you'll be there, bare-brained and headfirst in the New NET. ▶ Role Ability: inteRFACe The Netrunner's Role Ability is Interface. Interface is what allows the Netrunner to Netrun—to interface with electronic mind-modems (called cyberdecks) to control computers, electronics, and associated program- ming. The Interface Role Ability also gives the Netrunner access to a wide suite of Abilities related to computer hacking and system control (Go to pg. 147 for details). 33 \"Just beCAuse the woRlD Got DiPPeD in \"Just beCAuse the woRlD Got DiPPeD in CrapCrap AnD hunG to DRy Doesn't meAn thinGs hAve AnD hunG to DRy Doesn't meAn thinGs hAve ChAnGeD thAt muCh. liFe in this City still DePenDs on ChAnGeD thAt muCh. liFe in this City still DePenDs on teChnologyteChnology to keeP eveRythinG to keeP eveRythinG FRom GoinG Full-on Post-APoCAlyPse.

You've always got at least two screwdrivers and a wrench in your pockets. Computer down? No problem. Hydrogen burner out in your Metrocar? No problem. Can't get the video to run or your interface glitching? No problem. You make your living building, fixing, and modi- fying—a crucial occupation in a technological world recovering from a War that broke the back of the supply chain. You can make some good bucks fixing everyday stuff, but for the serious money you need to tackle the big jobs. Illegal weapons. Illegal or stolen cybertech. Corporate espionage and counter-espionage gear for \"black operations.\" If you're any good, you're making a lot of money. And that money goes into new gadgets, hardware, and information. Your black market work isn't just making you friends—it's also racking you up an impressive number of enemies as well—so you invest a lot in defense systems and, if really pushed to the wall, call in a few markers on a Solo or two. You've fixed up tech for everybody from black ops Corporate samurai to Ms. Zepada down the block.

Using the Maker Role Ability, the Tech can fix, improve, modify, make, and invent new items.

You've got the best tools the Time of the Red can offer, and you know how to use them. If you're lucky, you got to attend one of the real med schools scattered around the wreck of the Old United States. And after the War, military hospitals were everywhere and the few doctors on the war front needed helping hands to hold down screaming patients and splice cyberware back together. So, maybe you learned that way. And there's always an old ripperdoc or two out there who hearken back to that old science fiction story called The Bladerunner—not that old flatscreen vid, but the really old sci-fi book about renegade doctors who performed illegal street surgery in one of the first dys- topian novels.

It's the best of the best—Trauma Team charges some heavy subscription fees to save its clients, and that translates into new medical toys, faster AV ambulances, and hefty salaries for the best surgeons around. It doesn't matter how you got here. What matters is that you're here, on The Street, doing the job. And you'd be doing it no matter what the reason. It's what marks you as a Medtech. ▶ Role Ability: meDiCine The Medtech's Role Ability is Medicine. With this ability, Medtechs can keep people alive who should be dead with their knowledge, tools, and training. In the Time of the Red, they are as much doctors as they are mechanics, caring for people who are often more machine than human. Whenever the Medtech increases their Medicine Rank, they also choose one of three Medicine Specialties to allocate a single point to: surgery, pharmaceuticals, or cryosystems operation (Go to pg. 149 for details). 35 \"useD to woRk FoR niGht City toDAy, CAn you believe it? \"useD to woRk FoR niGht City toDAy, CAn you believe it? fetChingfetChing CoFFee AnD CoFFee AnD totingtoting CAmeRA GeAR like A GoDDAmneD PACk mule!

And you're going to stop them. Someone has to do it. The Corporations used to rule the world. They dumped toxics, destabilized economies, and com- mitted murder with equal impunity. The government back then couldn't even stop them—hell, they owned the government. But then the War came. The War stripped away the facade and let us all know exactly what had been going on under our noses. And the people who made sure we all knew the score were the Medias. That's you. You've got a vidlink and a press pass, and you're not afraid to use them. You're a city-wide figure, seen nightly all over the Data Pool in the Time of the Red. It's not like the old days, when you had a major Mediacorp behind you; this time, you've gotta depend on your fans, your contacts, and your own reputation. But it's harder for these new Corps to make you disappear. So when you dig down for the dirt and slime the corrupt officials and Corporate lapdogs try to cover up, you can dig deep. The next morning, you can put the details of their crimes all over the screamsheets and vidscreens. Three or four times, the bad guys have tried to kill you—that's why your backup's a crack Solo bodyguard and you've got one of the top ‘Runners in the business digging through NET Architectures to back your stories. You have to be good, or else. Your ‘Runner's just phoned in with a hot lead. You grab your gear and flag your backup. You're going to break those bastards. This time, for sure. ▶ Role Ability: CReDibility The Media's Role Ability is Credibility. The Media can not only convince an audience of the truth of what they publish but also has a larger audience the more credible they are. Medias also have greater levels of access to sources and information; they are always in the know with their ears to the ground to pick up on rumors and information passively (Go to pg. 151 for details). 36 EXEC \"iF you wAnt to \"iF you wAnt to makemake it in the neoCoRPoRAte woRlD you hAve to RemembeR it in the neoCoRPoRAte woRlD you hAve to RemembeR the numbeR one Rule: stAy the numbeR one Rule: stAy hungryhungry.

Sure, it was selling your soul to the Company, but face it: the Corporations ruled the world. They controlled governments, markets, nations, armies—you name it. And you knew that whoever controlled the Corporations controlled everything else. But things changed when the largest Megacorps on the planet got into a major war that was equal to anything any real national governments could have thrown down. Okay, so right now your life as a junior executive is any- thing but easy. There are those underneath you who'd kill for a shot at your job. Literally. There are those over you who'd kill to keep you out of their jobs. Literally. And they're not kidding about the killing—every up-and-comer in the Corporation has their own Team of Solos and Netrunners to cover important pet projects. Last week, you led a mixed team of Solos, Netrunners, and Techs on a headhunting run to \"extract\" a researcher from a rival company. You told yourself you joined the Corporation to make it a better place—work from the inside, you said. Or just until you could start your own Corporation that would be...a little more honest. But now you're not so sure. Your ideals are a little tarnished and things are getting pretty bleak. But you can't worry about ethics now. You've got a report due in an hour, and it looks like that guy in sales is planning to ice your database for good. You're gonna ice him first. ▶ Role Ability: teAmwoRk The Exec's Role Ability is Teamwork. Just like a real corporate executive, the Exec builds a team whose members help them accomplish their goals, whether legal or not, morale permit- ting. Team members have a visible job description (like secre- tary or driver) but also have a covert roles (such as Netrunner, bodyguard, or assassin). Plus they get free housing and nice set of clothes!

Now you're lucky if you just take a slug. The Street is mean these days, filled with new drugs, new gangs, and new weapons that make a Minami-10 look like a kid's toy. But even so, you're out there doing what you can to Protect and Serve. There used to be a big City Force, but most of the Old Guard in NCPD have been thrown out on their own to keep what peace they can. The ones who remain still take the Badge seriously; they work to keep people safe and make some kind of stand against chaos. Even if you'd rather just walk a beat, if you're a professional Lawman of any stripe, you're stuck carrying at least four high-caliber weapons, most of them full-auto types, wearing a Kevlar® vest that'll stop 850ft/lbs. per square inch—and often you're still outgunned and outflanked. Half the gangs were cybered up to begin with: super speed, super reflexes, could see in the dark, carried weapons in their arms...and that was before the War and the Fall of the Towers pumped a metric ton of milspec cybertech into the Night Markets. The other half of the guys on The Street are freelance Corporate mercs who used to have jobs during the War; hired to enforce Corp armies disbanded by the New United States' goon squads. Now they're the goon squads and you're trying to keep them under control too. Used to be the Corporate Cops had heavy weapons, full combat armor, Trauma Team backup, AV-4 assault vehicles, and gyrocopters with miniguns. But the nice, clean sectors full of new office buildings and fancy restaurants—where no jacked-up psychopunk is going to ever go on a killing spree with an FN-RAL— are mostly gone. Now you've got mostly burned-out buildings and abandoned cars, where every night is a new firefight and another great opportunity for a messy death. Or you might draw a Psycho Squad berth and get the job of hunting down heavily armed and armored cyborgs who've flipped out. A cyberpsycho can walk through machine gun fire and not even feel it, so a lot of the Psycho Squad become a bit crazy themselves; they load up with boosted reflexes, get some monstrously huge guns, and go hunt the cyborgs solo. But you're not that crazy. Yet. ▶ Role Ability: bACkuP The Lawman's Role Ability is Backup. With this ability, Lawmen can call upon the help of a group of fellow officers, based on the Lawman's Rank and the conditions under which they make the call. This Backup is armed and armored based on their Rank (Go to pg. 158 for details). 38 FIXER \"think oF me As A \"think oF me As A middlemanmiddleman. iF you neeD A teAm oF killeRs, A new CAR, A RARe Antique? . iF you neeD A teAm oF killeRs, A new CAR, A RARe Antique? i'm youR mAn.

But you always knew you had a knack for figuring out what other people wanted, and how to get it for them. For a price, of course. Now your deals have moved past the nickel-and-dime stuff into the big time. Maybe you move illegal weapons over the border. Or steal and resell medical supplies. Perhaps you're a skill broker acting as an agent for high-priced Solos and 'Runners, or even hiring a whole Nomad pack to back a client's contracts. You buy and sell favors like an old-style Mafia godfather. You have connections into all kinds of businesses, deals, and political groups. You use your contacts and allies as part of a vast web of intrigue and coercion. If there's a hot nightclub in the City, you've bought into it. If there are military-class weapons on The Street, you smuggled ‘em in. If there's a faction war going down, you're negotiating between sides with an eye on the main chance. But you're not entirely in it for the bucks. If someone needs to get the heat off, you'll hide them. You get people housing when there isn't any, and you bring in food when the streets are blockaded. Maybe you do it because you know they'll owe you later, but you're not sure. You're one part Robin Hood and two parts AI Capone. In the past, they would have called you a crime lord. But this is the fragmented, nasty, deadly Time of the Red. So now they call you a Fixer. ▶ Role Ability: oPeRAtoR The Fixer's Role Ability is Operator. Fixers know how to get things on the black market and are adept at navigating the complex social customs of The Street, where hundreds of cultures and economic levels collide. Fixers maintain vast webs of contacts and clients who they can reach out to source goods, favors, or information. Fixers can also source desirable resources and make favorable deals (Go to pg. 159 for details). 39 NOMAD \"PeoPle DiDn't useD to \"PeoPle DiDn't useD to CareCare muCh About us nomADs. my FAmily CAme AnD went muCh About us nomADs. my FAmily CAme AnD went like the like the windwind AnD PeoPle PAiD About As muCh Attention. hell, most times, iF Folks AnD PeoPle PAiD About As muCh Attention. hell, most times, iF Folks DiD tAke notiCe they tRieD to DiD tAke notiCe they tRieD to throwthrow us out. but thinGs ARe us out. but thinGs ARe differentdifferent now. now. tuRns out, when soCiety bReAks Down, wAnDeReRs beCome tuRns out, when soCiety bReAks Down, wAnDeReRs beCome usefuluseful. now PeoPle . now PeoPle PAy us to PAy us to movemove theiR CARGo AnD keeP the sCAvs oFF them. suits me Just Fine. theiR CARGo AnD keeP the sCAvs oFF them. suits me Just Fine. theRe's nothinG like the theRe's nothinG like the freedomfreedom oF the oPen RoAD unDeR youR wheels. i've Got oF the oPen RoAD unDeR youR wheels. i've Got my my bikebike, i've Got my , i've Got my gungun, AnD i've Got my , AnD i've Got my familyfamily. thAt's All i'll eveR neeD.\" . thAt's All i'll eveR neeD.\" Racer rajavi, Aldecaldo Nomad Racer rajavi, Aldecaldo Nomad Years ago, the Corps drove your family off the farm. They rolled in, took over the land, and put rent-a-cops all over the place. But that was before the War. You were loners, homeless, until you created a Nomad Pack of nearly two-hundred members. Back then, your Pack was crammed into a huge, ragtag fleet of cars, vans, buses, and RVs roaming the freeways looking for supplies, odd jobs, and spare parts in a fragmented world. The Pack was your home—it had teachers, Medtechs, leaders, and mechanics—a virtual town on wheels in which everyone was related by marriage or kinship. But in the Time of the Red, your Nomad Pack has evolved. Your knowledge of roadcraft—of how to get between the safezones over the savage highways has allowed you to become the masters of getting people, supplies, and materials to a world that desperately needs them. Your cousins on the open seas have taken over the huge container ships and turned them into the Nomad convoys keeping civilization running. Your Deltajock fam- boys keep the supply lines to the Orbital Highriders open. If it has to get somewhere and get there safely, Nomads get the job done. Your vehicles are well-armored and bristling with stolen weapons: miniguns, rocket launchers, and the like. Every kid knows how to use a rifle, and everyone packs a knife. Like modern-day cowboys, you ride the hard trail. You've got a gun, a bike, and your Family, and that's all you need. You're a Nomad. ▶ Role Ability: moto The Nomad's Role Ability is Moto. Whenever a Nomad increases their Rank in Moto, they have the option of adding another stock vehicle (with minimum specs) of their Moto Rank or lower to the pool of Family vehicles they have permission to use from the Family Motorpool or to make an upgrade to one of their current vehicles. Thanks to being around vehicles since birth, Nomads are also able to drive any type of vehicle with tremendous skill (Go to pg. 161 for details). 40 SOUL AND THE NEW MACHINE Now you know what kinds of people walk the streets of Night City and the Roles they fulfill. So, let's dive into the process of making your own Cyberpunk RED Character. T he Three Methods of Making a Character In Cyberpunk RED, there are three ways to generate your Character. Streetrat (Templates), Edgerunners (Fast and Dirty), and The Complete Package (Calculated). Each has its own advantages and disadvantages. Streetrats (Templates): If you've never roleplayed before or just want to get going without a lot of fuss, Templates are the fastest way to start creating a Character. But don't underestimate Templates! In the hands of an experienced roleplayer, even a tem- plate can be modified to make a unique and fully fleshed-out Character by expanding on the basics. By adding as you play, the Template gathers more individuality to itself, getting better and better the more you play. Edgerunners (Fast and Dirty): As you'll soon realize, the Cyberpunk RED Character Generation system is designed to give you a lot of flexibility. You can tailor the Character the way you want it, with lots of personal touches all through the process. But when you need to create a Character quickly and without a lot of painstaking detail, the Fast and Dirty method is an excellent option. Complete Packages (Calculated): The Calculated method is by far the most complex way to make a Cyberpunk RED Character. Yet the reward is the ability to create a Character that is exactly what you want, using pools of points to buy Statistics and Skills and starting money to buy weapons, armor, gear, and cyberware. The following sections give you the tools you need to create a Character. To help make sense of it, we're including handy step by step charts to guide you through the process. TaGGinG The PaThs To m a ke na v i g a t ing Character Generation easier, we're placing tags next to each relevant section so you can tell, at a glance, if a set of instruc- tions pertains to Streetrats, Edgerunners, or Complete Packages.

(If cloning worked that way, that is.) You got this half-formed person standing there, dripping with slime. Maybe you've got a vague idea of where you're going with the Character, but nothing else. So, how do you take this Blank and make them really Cyberpunk? You start with the Lifepath. Lifepath is a flowchart of \"plot complications\" designed to help you give your Cyberpunk Character an authentically Dark Future background. Its sections cover your cultural origins, your family, friends, enemies, personal habits, and even key life events. It's intended primarily as a guide; if you encounter something you don't think fits the Character you've envisioned, feel free to change the path as you see fit. And remember: Cyberpunk hinges on roleplaying, so make use of the information in your Lifepath run. It's a guaranteed adventure generator! the PeRsonAls Now, let's take a look at what's inside your punk's head (besides the cybernetics). For each table, you'll be rolling either 1d10 or 1d6 to determine a piece of your Characters history, their style, or their outlook on the world. In some cases you'll be called on to make multiple rolls on the same table. If at any point you roll something you don't think fits with your Character you can feel free to choose an option instead. \"i RemembeR she tolD me she wAs boRn in \"i RemembeR she tolD me she wAs boRn in miamimiami, , About 2004 oR so... she wAs PRetty suRe, About 2004 oR so... she wAs PRetty suRe, beCAuse she CoulD still beCAuse she CoulD still rememberremember whAt it'D whAt it'D been like when the euRos RoCkeD wAshinGton been like when the euRos RoCkeD wAshinGton AnD the neAR miss took out tAmPA...AnD the neAR miss took out tAmPA... \"she hAD these inCReDible \"she hAD these inCReDible blueblue eyes—CleAR eyes—CleAR thRouGh AnD thRouGh, like CRystAls oF lACe, AnD thRouGh AnD thRouGh, like CRystAls oF lACe, AnD A smile FRom A mAGAZine A smile FRom A mAGAZine dreamdream.

You either learn to deal with all kinds of people from all over a fractured and chaotic world, or you die the first time you look side-eye at the wrong person. Where you come from determines your native language. In RED, we assume everyone speaks Streetslang, the pidgin that has evolved to be used by almost everyone in the Dark Future, but you probably also have another primary tongue you learned at your mother's knee. After rolling to determine your general cultural region, choose one of the languages from the list adjacent to your cultural region. You begin with 4 points in that Language Skill. There are hundreds of languages spoken around the world but for our purposes here we've listed the most commonly spoken languages in each region during the Time of the Red. If you want your Character to speak a language that isn't represented you can go ahead and choose that language instead of one of the listed languages. Roll 1d10 or choose one.

She likes the idea of stringing together a bunch of random results into a comprehensive Character background. Victoria rolls a 6 on a d10. According to the Cultural Origins table, that means her Character, or her Character's family, was originally from Sub- Saharan Africa. Her GM tells her Africa's in the midst of a technological boom thank to its close associa- tion with the Highriders in orbit. Victoria has family in Ethiopia in real life, so she decides her Netrunner comes from there. She's not sure why her Character left home yet, but Victoria's certain the reason will come to her as she contin- ues along the Lifepath. Finally, Victoria looks over the Language list. She doesn't see Amharic, the official language of Ethiopia, there but the rules say she's free to add to the list if it makes sense. Victoria notes her Netrunner has 4 levels of the Language (Amharic) Skill.BY HÉLIO FRAZÃO 46 TALES FROM THE STREET ▶ Your Personality ◀ This is what you're like as a person.

Your clothes, hairstyles and even personal touches can determine how people will relate to you, for good or for bad. Remember: an Exec wearing Street Casual, a rainbow mohawk, and ritual scars is probably not going to get that promotion they wanted. Note that your clothing style is more about the style of clothes you favor, not the individual items. You could wear a tailored business suit jacket, a rawhide fringed Nomad jacket, a high-tech light collared urban flash jacket, or even a torn and ripped leather jacket with gang colors all over the back. Each one is the same item of clothing (jacket), but defined by the style of jacket your Character favors. Roll 1d10 or choose one for each column.

Next is Dress and Personal Style. There's three categories: Clothing Style, Hairstyle, and Affectation. V i c t or ia r ol l s 4 f or C l o t hin g S t y le : Businesswear. She rolls 9 for Hairstyle: Short and curly. And she rolls 5 for Affectation: Nose rings. Obviously, Victoria like to keep things neat and professional. Thinking about it, she decides her Netrunner gets this from her family, who instilled a need to \"dress to impress\" in her from a young age, especially when dealing with outsiders. \"Outsiders rarely look below the surface,\" her father told her, \"Make sure your surface says you mean business\". Victoria's Netrunner prefers sharp suits and keeps her hair short but natural. The nose ring is a little touch of home, as it was a gift Victoria's Character received before she left Ethiopia. 48 TALES FROM THE STREET ▶ Your Motivations and Relationships ◀ Roll 1d10 or choose one for each column.

Were you born with a silver spoon in your mouth or were you using it to stab your brother so you could steal that extra bite of dead rat you both found? Roll 1d10 or choose one. Roll Original Background Description 1 Corporate Execs Wealthy, powerful, with servants, luxury homes, and the best of everything. Private security made sure you were always safe. You definitely went to a big-name private school. 2 Corporate Managers Well to do, with large homes, safe neighborhoods, nice cars, etc. Sometimes your parent(s) would hire servants, although this was rare. You had a mix of private and corporate education. 3 Corporate Technicians Middle-middle class, with comfortable conapts or Beaverville suburban homes, minivans and corporate-run technical schools. Kind of like living 1950s America crossed with 1984. 4 Nomad Pack You had a mix of rugged trailers, vehicles, and huge road kombis for your home. You learned to drive and fight at an early age, but the family was always there to care for you. Food was actually fresh and abundant. Mostly home schooled. 5 Ganger \"Family\" A savage, violent home in any place the gang could take over. You were usually hungry, cold, and scared. You probably didn't know who your actual parents were. Education? The Gang taught you how to fight, kill, and steal—what else did you need to know? 6 Combat Zoners A step up from a gang \"family,\" your home was a decaying building somewhere in the ‘Zone', heavily fortified. You were hungry at times, but regularly could score a bed and a meal. Home schooled. 7 Urban Homeless You lived in cars, dumpsters, or abandoned shipping modules. If you were lucky. You were usually hungry, cold, and scared, unless you were tough enough to fight for the scraps. Education? School of Hard Knocks. 8 Megastructure Warren Rats You grew up in one of the huge new megastructures that went up after the War. A tiny conapt, kibble and scop for food, a mostly warm bed. Some better educated adult warren dwellers or a local Corporation may have set up a school. 9 Reclaimers You started out on the road, but then moved into one of the deserted ghost towns or cities to rebuild it. A pioneer life: dangerous, but with plenty of simple food and a safe place to sleep. You were home schooled if there was anyone who had the time. 10 Edgerunners Your home was always changing based on your parents' current \"job.\" Could be a luxury apartment, an urban conapt, or a dumpster if you were on the run. Food and shelter ran the gamut from gourmet to kibble. LifePaTh examPLe Victoria continues along the Lifepath past what her Character values most (knowledge), how she feels about people (she's neutral), her most valued person (a friend), and her most valued possession (a toy). Her Original Family Background is next. She rolls a 6 and gets Combat Zoners. Given what Victoria's already d e c i d e d o n f o r h e r Netrunner, that makes no sense so she switches to Corporate Technicians instead. Her fathers, she decides, worked in the motorpool for an Ethiopian company that specialized in exporting luxury goods up to the Highriders in orbit. She grew up fairly safe and secure and, while she inherited the family aptitude for tech- nology she's applied it to Netrunning instead of vehicle repair.BY HÉLIO FRAZÃO 50 TALES FROM THE STREET ▶ Your Environment ◀ How did you grow up?

R ole-Based Lifepaths Some things about life are universal. Other things are pretty specific. One of these is how your day job (or night job or side job or whatever—we won't judge you) affects your life.

LifePaTh examPLe Victoria flips to the Role Specific Lifepath for a Netrunner. She rolls a 1 on first table, meaning she's a freelancer who hacks for hire. She decides her Netrunner flies solo. Her workspace is, on a roll of 5, minimalist, clean, and organized. She rolls a 5 and discovers that, among her clients, are local Fixers who use her services to secure their systems. She gets her Programs from Night Markets with a roll of 6, and with a 1 on the Who's Gunning for You table, there's a rogue AI or NET Ghost after her! Victoria thinks about it and decides Maryam, her Netrunner, left home to seek her fortune after being rejected for a Highrider NET security position. When she got to Night City she quickly dis- covered jobs could hard to come by. Luckily, she made a friend who introduced her to some local Fixers who could use her skills to keep their data safe. As for her new enemy? It may be that, before she left Africa, Maryam cracked open an old Data Fortress Netwatch missed when it cleaned up the old NET and, just maybe, whatever was inside found a way to follow her to Night City.

If you're exhausted, you'll suffer penalties on Checks due to lack of sleep. Some Roles, such as Netrunner and Tech, roll on a Workspace table as part of their Role Specific Lifepath. The result rolled doesn't represent a physi- cal location the Character owns but, rather, what- ever space they set up to work in.

Under no circumstances d o e s a C h a r a c t e r ' s Workspace, by itself, count as Housing. If a Character sleeps in their Workspace, and t ha t Wor kspace isn't already part of their purchased Housing (in a spare room in their Conapt, for example), it counts as if they had slept in a vehicle for the purposes of deciding if they got a good night's sleep or not.got a partnerwork alone 60 ▶ What Kind of Medtech are You? ◀ Roll 1d10 or work with your GM to choose one.

EXEC execs and Lawmen in a PunK Game In the real world, it's unfor- tunately all too common for people with power to punch down at the people without it. That's doubly true in the world of Cyberpunk, where the Corps and police forces have more power than just about anyone else. Let's face it. If you're playing an Exec or a Lawman, there's a pretty good chance you aren't working for the good guys. Still, you need to ask yourself. In a world where Edgerunners often rail against the tyranny of authority, where does your Lawman or Exec fit in? Are they selfishly using the rest of the party for their own gain? Are they the classic \"kid made good\", hanging with old friends and caught between two worlds? Or are they star- ry-eyed dreamers, hoping to change the system from the inside? Those are all valid stories for you to tell. Just be careful. You know the old saying: power corrupts. 65 ▶ What is Your Position on the Force ◀ Roll 1d6 or work with your GM to choose one.

NOMAD 69 nomads in a ciTy Game In 2045, Nomads control the highways and sea lanes. Want to get cargo from point A to point B? Chances are you'll be contracting with Nomads to do so at ports and depot sites they run. They're also constr uction exper t s , putting their talents to work rebuilding what the 4th Corporate War broke. See that fancy megabuilding going up in the distance? There's probably a few hundred Nomads working that job. These days, several Nomad families mai nt ai n p er man ent enclaves either in Night City or on its outskirts. So, finding a reason for your Nomad to be in the City shouldn't be difficult. As for why they're hanging out with a bunch of statics (non-Nomads)? We recommend keeping it personal. Make it about the connection between your Nomad and one or more of the other Characters. Maybe the Fixer's working with your Pack to secure supplies and you've been assigned to keep an eye out. Or maybe your Pack owes the Medtech a favor. Talk to your GM. Talk to the other Players. You'll figure it out. ▶ What Do You Do for Your Pack? ◀ Roll 1d6 or choose one.

For example, if your roleplaying group were staging a recreation of the movie Blade Runner, the Android, Roy Batty (Mike's personal favorite, by the way) would be one of the Characters. BY HUNTANG 72 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE Much like actor Rutger Hauer, the person playing Roy in this adventure would try to act out what they thought the Character would be doing in each scene of the \"movie.\" But what keeps a Player from saying, \"Ah! When Deckard corners Roy, Roy uses his heat-ray vision to melt Deckard's gun?\" That's where the rules come in. To make sure a Character is played convincingly, the GM uses a set of structured guidelines (like these) to tell Players what is or isn't possible within the confines of the world. To set guidelines on what is possible for a particular Character, the GM starts out with the powerful tool of Statistics. W hat are Statistics? Statistics (also called STATs) are numbers that describe your Character's abilities in the game, as compared to everything else in the universe. All people and creatures can be described (or written up) using Statistics. This helps you compare Characters' abilities, which is often important in the game. For instance, a person with a STAT of 5 might be better off than a person with a STAT of 4, but not as good as a person with a STAT of 6. Statistics are generally rated from 1 to 8, but can go higher. In a Cyberpunk RED campaign, Characters will have Ten Primary Statistics, arranged into four groups: Mental, Combat, Fortune, and Physical. mentAl GRouP Intelligence (INT): How generally bright you are. As a rule, this is more than sheer intelligence, but also includes cleverness, awareness, perception, and your ability to learn. Willpower (WILL): Your determination and ability to face danger and/or stress. This STAT also rep- resents your courage and ability to survive long- term privation. This STAT is important for determining how much damage you can take. Cool (COOL): Your ability to impress and influence people through your character and charisma; how well you get along with others; how you interact in social situations. Empathy (EMP): Your ability to relate to and care for others, and take others into consideration. Particularly important as it offsets the effects of cyberpsychosis, a dangerous mental illness common in the Dark Future. CombAt GRouP Technique (TECH): Your ability to manipulate tools or instruments. This is not the same as Reflexes, inas- much as this covers the knack of using tools. One Character might have a high Technique but might not be able to fence or juggle. On the other hand, another might have high Reflexes, but might not be able to rewire a computer or hot-wire a car. Reflexes (REF): Your response time and coordina- tion, as used in aiming, throwing, juggling, etc. A stage magician, for example, would have a high Reflex STAT. Most importantly, this is the STAT that affects your ability to hit things with ranged weapons. FoRtune GRouP Luck (LUCK): How the gods of chance see you. With a high enough Luck, you can tip the scales in your favor. In a game mechanics sense, you can apply points from this STAT to offset die rolls in your favor. However, this pool of points only refills at the beginning of the next session. PhysiCAl GRouP Body (BODY): Your size, toughness, and ability to stay alive and conscious due to physical mass, structure, or other qualities. This STAT is important for determining how much damage you can take. Dexterity (DEX): Your overall physical compe- tence, as it pertains to balancing, leaping, jumping, combat, and other athletic activities. A gymnast would have a high Dexterity. Most importantly, this is the STAT that affects your ability to hit things with melee weapons and can help you dodge attacks. Movement (MOVE): Your speed of movement: running, leaping, swimming, etc. 73 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE H ow Do You Get Your STATs? Got it? Let's start with the first step to all these methods: the STAT Block. the stAt bloCk When creating a Character, you will be placing your STATs in a STAT Block like the one below: This block remains the same for all three types of Character Generation: Streetrats, Edgerunners, and Complete Packages. You will find a STAT Block similar to this on your Character Sheet. the thRee wAys to GeneRAte stAts ▶ Method #1: Streetrats (Templates) ◀ When using The Streetrat Option, you'll roll 1d10 and then copy the numbers adjacent to the result of that roll onto your Character Sheet. You may not move your STATs around; you must transfer them as written on the table for that Roll. The good news is that these tables have been computer-generated to give you an optimal Character for that type of Role. Example: Jay decides to play a Solo. Jay goes to the Template table for Solos and roll 1d10. Jay rolls a 6.

While it's the most flexible method, it's also the most time-consuming and is not recommended for novice roleplayers. When using the Complete Package option, your GM will give you a specific number of points with which to generate your Character's STATs (normally 62). The only limit is that no STAT may be higher than 8 or lower than 2. And we strongly suggest that GMs start their Players on the Starting Character rank. But we've also included Point Values for both higher and lower Characters based on the loose ranking system we used in previous editions of Cyberpunk (2013, 2020). Once again, we caution GMs to stick to the Starting Character version unless they are positively sure they want to change the play balance of their games. But hey, it's your funeral. Rank of Character STAT Points Minor Supporting Character 50 Starting Character 62 Major Supporting Character 70 Minor Hero 75 Major Hero 80 Divide up your STAT points between the ten STATs in the block. On average, you should be able to put at least 6 points in each STAT with a couple of points left over. Fine tuning these numbers is the fun part of the Complete Package option. Example: Once again, Jay decides to play a Solo. This time, Jay has 62 points with which to buy their Character's STATS. Jay starts by splitting the points evenly between the ten STATs in the block, but then starts to tinker with where the points will finally end up. In the end, Jay chooses to build a tough Solo who is more a physical fighter than a gunman, with more points in the Character's BODY, DEX, WILL, and MOVE STATs. ▶ luCk ▶ will ▶ move ▶ boDy ▶ emP ▶ Cool ▶ teCh ▶ Dex ▶ ReF ▶ int 5 7 8 3 6 7 6 8 8 4 ▶ luCk ▶ will ▶ move ▶ boDy ▶ emP ▶ Cool ▶ teCh ▶ Dex ▶ ReF ▶ int 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 6 62 points 62 points For STAT definitions Page 72 Next Step: Derived STATs Page 79 79 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE Note: We also could, at this point, warn prospective Gamemasters about the various dodges their Players will have for creating \"super-characters.\" But face it: if they want to create a mondo character, who are we to stop them? You're all big kids now, and if you, as GM, think your Players are getting way outta line, why not just go ahead and waste ‘em? That's the Cyberpunk way. RequiReD FoR eveRyone: DeRiveD stAtistiCs Regardless of the method you have chosen to generate your original STATs, you'll still need to calculate two more values: Hit Points and Humanity. These are your Character's Derived STATs, called so because they are derived from the original numbers in your STAT Block. These are STATs that are determined by doing something to an already existing STAT, like averaging, multiplying, or subtracting. ▶ Hit Points (HP) ◀ Hit Points are what we count to tell if your Character is dead, or still just bleeding on the floor. Every Character in a Cyberpunk RED campaign has this derived STAT. Hit Points represent the Character's will to live and overall physical condition. As the Character takes damage and injury from external sources, they'll subtract that damage (also described as points) from their pool of Hit Points. As the Character's HP reaches certain thresholds, there are penalties that represent cumulative damage that makes the Character physically slower or mentally hazier. When your Character falls to zero Hit Points, they enter the Death State (a measure of how fast they are dying). We'll go further into Wound Thresholds, penalties, and Death States in the Combat Section on pg. 186. You have Hit Points equal to 10 + (5[BODY and WILL averaged, rounding up]). But since the math involved can be a real pain sometimes, we've made you a table to use instead. Refer to the Table below to see how many Hit Points your Character has. Your Character's Seriously Wounded Wound Threshold is half of their total HP (rounded up). Their Death Save is equal to their BODY Statistic.

People with very low Humanity STATs have a lot of problems in human interactions. They may become sociopathic, withdrawn, disassociated, or even homicidal. If your Character's HUM drops below zero, that represents the death of your Character's emotional life; they slide into a state called cyberpsychosis, in which aberrant traits like homicidal mania, or mental disassociation can occur. While the addition of large amounts of cyberware (more on this later. See pg. 230) most often triggers this state, other traumatic situations can also push the Character over the edge. For every point of Empathy the Character has, they gain 10 points of Humanity (HUM). For example, a Character who starts with 5 EMP would have 50 Humanity. Once again, here's a handy table: Empathy (EMP) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Humanity (HUM) 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 As your Character undergoes Humanity Loss (mainly, but not always) through installing cybernetics, they lose points of Humanity. When you lose Humanity points you will sometimes have to lower your EMP Statistic. This happens every time the tens place of your Humanity value is lowered. For instance, a Character with 44 Humanity has an EMP of 4 until their Humanity is lowered to 39, at which point their EMP lowers to 3. For raising Humanity with therapy go to pg. 229. Plug these values into the Humanity, Hit Point, Seriously Wounded, and Death Save boxes on your Character Sheet and we're ready to hit the next stage: Skills. 81 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE S KILLS No matter what method you have used to gener- ate your Character's STATs so far, the next step of Character creation will be to find out what they can do. And that means Skills. whAt ARe skills? Skills are things that your Character knows or can do; they represent their level of knowledge and accom- plishment. A Skill is also something your Character knows how to do because of their training. They have spent time learning and mastering the intricacies of this knowledge either from a teacher, a book, or a long and arduous montage sequence typically found in action and kung-fu movies. The Level of a Skill represents how well trained your Character is in that activity. ▶ Skills Link to STATs ◀ In turn, each Skill is also linked to a STAT that rep- resents natural ability. Some people are just naturally better at doing/learning things than other people around them. So when you perform a \"Skill Check\" (more on this later, pg. 128) you'll add the STAT that is linked to that particular Skill to get a total aptitude at performing an Action based on that Skill, also known as a Skill Base. ▶ All Skills are Not Equal ◀ Some Skills are harder to learn than others (more teaching, bigger books to read, more arduous training montages) and this is reflected in the \"cost\" to \"buy\" these Skills. We'll make a note if a Skill has a higher cost in its description in the Skill Lists below by marking it with (x2). Any Skill marked this way costs twice the number of points to buy (2 points per 1 Level). In a Cyberpunk RED campaign, there are nine Skill Categories: Awareness Skills: Your awareness of your environ- ment, noticing clues, etc. Body Skills: The use of Skills involving physical tasks, feats of strength, endurance, and other physical attributes. Control Skills: The use of Skills involving controlling vehicles or riding animals. Education Skills: Knowledge and training based on formal education/schooling. Fighting Skills: The ability to fight in hand-to-hand combat, or with a melee weapon. Performance Skills: Training in acting, musician- ship, special effects, makeup, or other stage crafts. Ranged Weapon Skills: Skills in using a ranged weapon, such as a gun or a bow. Social Skills: Your abilities to blend in, avoid social blunders, and to show style and grace. Also, your ability to convince others through social adeptness. Technique Skills: Trained vocational Skills and craftsmanship abilities. i i startedstarted out mAkinG FAlse iDs out mAkinG FAlse iDs FoR eDGeRunneRs AnD stReetRAts. FoR eDGeRunneRs AnD stReetRAts.

Skills are like STATs; they have a range of effectiveness that is related to how much they cost. ▶ Basic Skills ◀ Basic Skills are things generally common to everyone in all cultures in the Time of the Red: Athletics, Brawling, Concentration, Conversation, Education, Evasion, First Aid, Human Perception, Language (Streetslang), Local Expert (Your Home), Perception, Persuasion, and Stealth. These are assumed to be part of everyone's Skill list and must start with at least a value of 2. Additionally, all Characters begin with 4 points in a language related to Cultural Background, as established in Lifepath on page 45. 86 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE ▶ Method #1: Streetrat (Templates) Skills ◀ Skills are predetermined from the start with The Streetrat.

But the big difference here is that although your Skills for that Role are predetermined, the levels of each Skill are up to you. There are a few rules though: • Edgerunners get 86 Skill points to be distributed between your Character's Skills to raise their totals up. These points may not be applied anywhere else. • No Skill can be higher than 6 or lower than 2. • The following Skills must be at least Level 2: Athletics, Brawling, Concentration, Conversation, Education, Evasion, First Aid, Human Perception, Language (Streetslang), Local Expert (Your Home), Perception, Persuasion, and Stealth. • Skills marked with a (x2) cost two Skill points to increase in Level by one. All other Skills cost one point to increase in Level by one. • Don't forget the 4 Levels of Language you get free based on the Cultural Origin section of your Lifepath (see pg. 45). To determine your Edgerunner's Skills, just find your Role on the tables below, then divide your 86 Skill points up between the Skills listed for that type. Remember that no Skill can be higher than 6 or lower than 2. Hot Tip: You'll notice that each Role has 20 Skills allotted to it. Start by dividing your 86 points by 20 to get a rough average of 4 points per Skill (you'll have 6 extra points left over).

Example: Jay decides to work on an Edgerunner Solo. This Solo has the following Skills: Athletics, Brawling, Concentration, Conversation, Education, Evasion, First Aid, Human Perception, Language (Streetslang), Local Expert (You Home), Perception, Persuasion, Stealth, Autofire, Handgun, Interrogation, Melee Weapon, Resist Torture/Drugs, Shoulder Arms, and Tactics. Jay slots 4 points into each of these and spends the remaining 6 points as they see fit. Now Jay starts shifting the points between Skills, until the result looks like so: Total Cost: 86 90 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE ▶ Method #3: Complete Package (Calculated) Skills ◀ Unlike the other types of Characters (Streetrats and Edgerunners) Complete Package (Calculated) Characters get almost complete control over their Skills. Like Edgerunners, these Characters get 86 Skill points to raise up any Skills they want. But unlike Edgerunners, except for Basic Skills that all Character types must have (see below), the Complete Package Player can put the rest of their 86 points in any Skills they want. In the Complete Package Method, four things should be kept in mind. • No Skill can be higher than 6. • The following Skills must be at least Level 2: Athletics, Brawling, Concentration, Conversation, Education, Evasion, First Aid, Human Perception, Language (Streetslang), Local Expert (Your Home), Perception, Persuasion, and Stealth • Skills marked in the Master Skill List with a (x2) cost two Skill points to increase in Level by one. All other Skills cost one Skill point to increase in Level by one. • Don't forget the 4 Levels of Language you get free based on the Cultural Origin section of your Lifepath (see pg. 45). Example: Jay decides to build a Solo, but this time as a Complete Package Character. Their Solo must have the following Skills at Level 2: Athletics, Brawling, Concentration, Conversation, Education, Evasion, First Aid, Human Perception, Language (Streetslang), Local Expert (Your Home), Perception, Persuasion, and Stealth. He chooses most of these at the bare minimum (not exactly the best idea). However, Jay also decides to make their Solo as a more esoteric Character who spends time hunting down renegade Nomads in the wilderness. So, the remaining 60 of their Skill points are spent on the following: Skill Level Cost Athletics 2 2 Brawling 2 2 Concentration 2 2 Conversation 2 2 Education 2 2 Evasion 2 2 First Aid 2 2 Human Perception 2 2 Language (Streetslang) 2 2 Language (Based on Cultural Origin) 4 0 Local Expert (Your Home) 2 2 Perception 2 2 Persuasion 2 2 Stealth 2 2 Skill Level Cost Autofire (x2) 6 12 Deduction 4 4 Drive Land Vehicle 4 4 Endurance 4 4 Handgun 4 4 Interrogation 4 4 Martial Arts (x2) 2 4 Melee Weapon 5 5 Resist Torture/Drugs 4 4 Shoulder Arms 4 4 Tactics 3 3 Tracking 4 4 Wilderness Survival 4 4 Total Cost: 86 Skill definitions Page 81 Next Step: Weapons, Armor, Gear, and Cyberware Page 104 91 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE N ext Up: Weapons and Armor You don't have to have cyberware to be a Cyberpunk. But you do need weapons and armor. In the Dark Future of the Time of the Red, there aren't many convenient cops around to cover your butt when things get sticky. weAPons Let's talk about things that go Bang... or Chop, Chop, Slice Weapons are part of everyday life in the Time of the Red. With only a few cops on The Street and lots of heavily armed and armored miscreants roaming around just itching to reduce you to salable parts, it's no wonder that everyone you meet is probably packing. The trick is to make sure you're carrying more than they are—and that you know enough about how to use it so that they don't take it away from you. ▶ Weapon Categories ◀ There's three categories of weapons: Melee Weapons: Swords, axes, clubs, hammers, etc. Ranged Weapons: Things that are fired, shot or thrown. Exotic Weapons: Melee or Ranged Weapons that are specialized or don't fit the above categories. Many weapons can either be traditional (something you hold and can put down) or implanted into your body as cyberware. Known on The Street as cyberweapons, implanted weapons are usually a variant of Ranged or Melee Weapon. Some oddities, like the infamous cybersnake are, on the whole, only loosely classified as Melee Weapons, if at all. These all have their own specialized uses, so we'll be talking more about those in the Cyberware chapter on pg. 110. Note that these are only the most basic, almost generic classes of each weapon. We'll be looking at specific weapons, models, and brands later on in the Night Market section on pg. 342. M elee Weapons These are things you swing or stab at someone, hoping to beat them bloody or remove their limbs. Swords, axes, clubs, hammers—the whole contents of the hardware aisle in your local night market. If you use your hands to deliver the damage with it, it's a Melee Weapon.

Guns, lasers (rare), gyrojets (rarer still), even the little hand-crossbows that those idiots in the road-warrior gangs like to wave around. If something comes out of it, traverses a distance, and causes damage at the end of that trajectory, it's a Ranged Weapon. Ranged Weapons are generally linked to the REF STAT. When buying Ranged Weapons, it's important to keep in mind that all weapons are effective at different ranges. An assault rifle is great for long-range shots and mid-range fire fights but it can be unwieldy in tight corridors and close-quarters gunfights.

They are typically variants of existing weapon types. All Exotic Weapons are Average Weapon Quality and are incompatible with all Weapon Attachments and Non-Basic Ammunition unless otherwise stated. The table below offers a brief glimpse of Exotic Weapons. For a full description and rules for each, see page 347. how to ReAD the exotiC weAPon tAble Name: What we call it. While, in many cases, this is a generic name; there are lots of brands to choose from. Description & Data: The specifics of the weapon are listed here. In most cases, the Exotic Weapon will refer to a Non-Exotic Weapon listed in the Melee or Ranged Weapons table. With the exception of anything noted here, the weapon functions the same as its Non-Exotic counterpart. Cost: What the weapon costs in the main currency in Night City, the Eurobuck. The Price Category of the item is listed below its cost. See Buying and Selling on Page 385. Note to GMs: During Character Generation, a Player is able to buy anything they have the funds to purchase but they are are not allowed to pool their starting money together. We recommend that you don't give your Players additional starting funds. Allowing Players access to Luxury or higher Price Category items at Character Generation could break your game. But, if you wanna to attend your own funeral, we've included them in the chart below. In gameplay, Exotic Weapons are rare and expensive. They are difficult to find at Night Markets without a friendly Fixer and carrying one can really make a statement. If you walk into the Totentanz with a Constitution Arms Hurricane Assault Weapon slung over your shoulder, people will take notice. For better or worse.

You can combine multiple attachments that take up the same physical location, but you must pay the slot cost of both attachments independently. Equipping the same attachment twice does nothing. Attachments are made for specific weapon types and cannot be easily retrofitted for other weapon types. These specialized types of attachments are available in the Night Market Section of this book (pg. 342). A rmor Because only an idiot stands there and takes getting shot. Even in a world where cybertechnology can make every man-jack a full-metal warrior, armor is still very important in the Time of the Red. The armors described here are, like the weapons above, fairly generic, as they include all kinds of clothing, suit cuts, jumpsuits, miniskirts, and whatever else a well-dressed punk on The Street considers the height of protective fashion. Again, if you really don't know how to rate your new ICONAmerica ensemble, decide what description best fits what it's mostly made of (leather, Kevlar®, plastic plating, or even chain mail) and go from there. Armor must be purchased individually for either the head or body locations. Wearing even a single piece of heavier armor will lower your REF, DEX, and MOVE by the most punishing Armor Penalty of armor you are wearing. You take this penalty only once even though you are likely wearing armor on both your body and head. This penalty can even leave your Character (at a minimum of MOVE 0) completely immobile. SP gained by armor does not \"stack;\" Only your highest source of SP in a location determines your SP for that location. All your worn armor in a location is ablated (SP lowered by one) simultaneously whenever you take damage. See When Armor Doesn't Cut It on pg. 186. how to ReAD the ARmoR tAble Armor Type: What we generally call it. There are a lot of brands; this is the generic title. Armor Description: What it looks/wears like. If the armor has any effects or special notes this is where they will be listed. Stopping Power: How many points of damage from an attack the armor can stop before it reaches your body. Armor Penalty: How much does the Armor interfere with your ability to move and respond while wearing it. Cost: What the armor costs in the main currency in Night City, the Eurobuck. The Price Category of the item is listed below its cost. See Buying and Selling on Page 385. sPeciaL ammuniTion Beyond Basic Ammunition, all Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons can be loaded with non- Basic t ypes of ammunition such as Incendiary Shells, Poisoned Arrows, Armor-Piercing Bullets, and so forth.

Go to pg. 104 to find the rules for Complete Package Characters. N ext: Your Outfit What do you have in your pockets? Besides a... gun? Let's get this straight. A Cyberpunk future is mobile. Like the cowboys of the Old West, most people in this time carry their lives on their backs—a world of miniaturized sleeping, eating, and entertainment components crammed into carryalls and the back seats of cars. The gear you carry around is known on The Street as your outfit. A typical outfit might include: • Inflatable Bed & Sleep-bag (folds to a 6\"x6\" package for easy storage). • Personal Agent (a micro-sized communications system and computer that fits in your pocket). • A pocket-load of Memory Chips. • A Cyberdeck and cables (for Netrunners). • A Techtool or other tools. • Easily portable food in the form of bars, squeeze tubes, foil packs, ready to eat meals (MREs), and the occasional banana (worth its weight in gold in the Time of the Red). • Personal effects, like clothes, toothbrushes, etc. Most of this is crammed into a shoulder bag or duffel sack. In the Time of the Red, Cyberpunk RED Characters still aren't much for settling down. Rockerboys always have the next gig. Solos have to keep moving; the next job requires it, and you keep moving anyway before your enemies figure out where you're sleeping these days. Cops, Netrunners, Medias, and Techies are always on the move; on stakeouts, hard stories, or running from the various people you've brought down on yourself with your Netrunning. Nomads...well, they don't have homes to start with (unless you count their kombis) and what good is it if you can't cram it on the back of your bike anyway? 100 FITTED FOR THE FUTURE At this point we're not going to worry about any of the other stuff in your life: your home, your rent, how you make enough scratch to pay for a bag of Kibble Product #19.

On the other hand, if you are an Exec, you'll start off living rent free in a Corporate Conapt in a Corporate Zone, and living a comfortable Good Prepak Lifestyle, which is already paid for this month. See pg. 377 for more information about your living situation and what it entails. You don't have to pay rent because you're better than other people, but maintaining your Good Prepak Lifestyle will run you 600eb on the first of every month. Nomads have an additional Housing option, due to their Moto Role Ability. See Pg. 165 for more details. Example: As a Solo, Jay's Character begins play living in a Cargo Container with a Kibble Lifestyle. He gets this free for one month. After that, he'll have to pay rent or get kicked out (or move to a better or worse place, depending on his finances) and buy another month of Lifestyle or starve. N ext Up: Your Cyberware Time to chip in, Choomba. The last step in creating your Character is getting them some cyberware. Cyberware is everywhere in the Time of the Red and everybody uses it differently. Before you pick your poison, let's take a trip down to the ripperdoc to see exactly what you're getting yourself into.

Or you can be dead. But the more you can add; the more you can bring that meat you were born with up to the next level, the better you can be. And that means less of a chance of ending up on the dead side of the equation.\" Damien tech 108 PUTTING THE CYBER INTO THE PUNK B efore we Start... Let's begin by straightening one thing out: It's cyber- ware. Not cyberwear. Cyberwear is stuff you can remove. You're just wearing it, chombatta. You're a tourist. You're not yet committed to the Edge. Cyberware is the various types of \"hardware\" you actually have implanted in or replacing parts of your body. It's the stuff that you live with. You see it as part of your body in a way your favorite jacket will never be. It's like your heart, or your hands, or your gonads. When you get it installed, you're making a major com- mitment. You're replacing or enhancing something you were born with. That's staying on the Edge. Got it? Okay then... First, forget everything you ever thought about cyborgs. Everything. This is the Dark Future—the Time of the Red. Even if the supply lines are down, the stores have been looted, and you have to buy it in the Night Markets, today's cyborg is still committed to being stylish. Cybernetic design focuses on a stream- lined, high-mover lifestyle. Whether equipped with implanted memory chips in your nervous system to enhance a street fight, or bio-engineered mini-weap- ons for your personal protection, the cyborg of the Time of the Red is always on the cutting edge of high- tech living. style oveR FunCtion But they aren't necessarily a walking tank either. Cyberware should be smoother than that—less obvious. You'll have to integrate your new-tech gadgets into a slick, seamless whole. You're either predator or prey in the City, and the faster you learn to blur the line between the two categories, the longer you'll survive. And that's the point: survival. the CybeR liFestyle It's \"hip and aware\" to have high-tech grafted into your body somewhere. If you can afford it, you prob- ably have at least a couple of \"enhancements\": a few chips installed in your nervous system to interface with your computer, remember your appointments, and improve your cyberball reflexes. If you're cybered up, you probably have interface plugs to operate com- puters and vehicles mentally. Maybe your eyes are cyberoptics with a recording function and the latest iris tint (polychrome is in this year), or you've boosted your hearing to better hear the gossip in the Executive Lounge. Though this type of Cyberware is rarer in the Time of the Red. If your job involves some type of security or combat function (and most occupations in this time have at least some type of combat aspect), you probably have two or three types of combat chipware, as well as plugs for a smartgun. As a Solo, you may have had an arm or a leg replaced with a cyberlimb, allowing you to hide a variety of tools and weapons in your body, as well as giving you an edge in speed and strength. And even if your job technically doesn't involve violence, it's a safe bet that you're not going to be wandering The Street without some kind of nastiness implanted in your body. \"Better cyber than sorry,\" is what The Street says about that. So as a Cyberpunk, you're going to want to get your hands on the best of this exciting and expensive tech. And \"expensive\" is the word. The average enhanced Character with, say, two cybereyes (targeting scope and IR enhancement), speedware, one super-chromed arm with a .25 cal submachine gun, interface plugs, and chipware for Brawling, Driving, and First Aid is an investment of thousands of eurobucks. If you can even find all that hardware. There was a War choomba, and some of the best stuff's been hoarded or just plain torn apart in the corporate battlefields of the urban zones. Of course, the ambitious punk already knows at least twenty-five ways (most of them illegal) to raise that sort of paltry sum; and they have the connections to get them in the Night Markets. But before you start loading up, there's a catch. C yberpsychosis Cyberpsychosis is a dissociative disorder which occurs when someone with preexisting psychopathic tendencies enhances themselves via cybernetics to the point they no longer see themselves or others There's more information about Cyberpsychosis in play on Page 230 109 PUTTING THE CYBER INTO THE PUNK as complete, sapient organisms, but simply as a collection of replaceable parts. Common symptoms of cyberpsychosis include lack of self-preservation, complete disregard for others, poor impulse control, and explosive outbursts. Let's get this clear from the start: if you already have these underlying psycho- logical issues (in game represented by a very low Empathy) you are more likely to be a candidate for cyberpsychosis). Installing cyberware isn't the only way to edge towards this mental explosion. Strong and/or hor- rific events and situations can also wear down your Humanity. And unfortunately, Edgerunners deal with these sorts of situations on a regular basis. This is something your GM controls; they often times may attach a Humanity cost on an event or situation (like when you stumble across a pack of scavvers eating a baby: Humanity Loss of at least 6 points right there.) PRACtiCinG sAFe CybeR On the other hand, not all cyberware and augmen- tations contribute to cyberpsychosis. In the Time of the Red, people who lose parts of themselves or were born without parts have the option to buy Medical- Grade Cyberware (see pg. 226) which functions only as a replacement and has no Humanity cost. Medical implants are treated the same as long as they have a therapeutic use. Similarly, people undergoing gender affirmation surgery or other forms of thera- peutic body modification choose to use Bodysculpting (see pg. 226) which has no Humanity cost. Only cyberware used to replace perfectly functional body parts or enhance the body beyond the human base- line can push someone towards cyberpsychosis. Even then, there are some therapeutic options available (see pg. 229). the PsyCho squAD Cyberpsychosis has always been a big problem in the Dark Future. While state-sponsored therapy is an option, the hardest part is getting the patient into the psychologist's office. What do you do when a met- al-armored, cyberboosted maniac starts randomly killing people? If you're the government, you organize a special squad of professional police with one job: to hunt down and capture or kill murderous cyberpsy- chos. If there isn't much government left, the locals will probably start their own Psycho Squad Militia and go after your 'borged-up butt anyway, even without a warrant. Psycho Squads are common to most urban or cor- porate police departments, going under names like C-SWAT (Cybernetic Special Weapons & Tactical Squad), PSYCHE-DIV, CYB-Enforcement, and MAX-TAC (Maximum Force Tactical Division). Armed with the best in armor, comm equipment, and vehi- cles, most carry weapons that start at the light cannon range and go up from there. They are, by nature, not very nice people. Now you know. Walk carefully. Guard your mind.BY RICHARD BAGNALL 110 PUTTING THE CYBER INTO THE PUNK C yberware Cybertechnology or Street Cyberware Cybertechnology can be purchased almost anywhere. Some of the medical procedures are simple: walk-in types of surgery with minor installations taking place in whatever shopping mall clinics (Bodyshoppe, Fashion/Fusion, and Parts N' Programs are three popular chain stores) still exist, or drop-in medical centers (Docs R Us™). These installations are much like getting your ears pierced. You can even have upgrades and improvements plugged into the old hardware for the cost of the new parts, allowing you to start small (called \"stripped\" or \"economy\") and add as you go. You can't install cyberware if you're suffering a Critical Injury related to it. For more information, see pg. 220. the GooDies: CybeRwARe tyPes There are 8 types of Cyberware. Fashionware: Stuff you install for personal adornment. See Page 111 for list. Neuralware: Stuff you install to enhance or augment your reflexes and mental abilities. See Page 112 for list. Cyberoptics: Stuff you install to improve visual abilities. See Page 112 for list. Cyberaudio Stuff you install to improve hearing and auditory abilities. See Page 113 for list. Internal Body Cyberware: Stuff that is implanted in your body and works like organs or systemic improve- ments. See Page 114 for list. External Body Cyberware: Stuff that is installed in, on, over or immediately through the skin. See Page 114 for list. Cyberlimbs: Cybernetic arms or legs that can be enhanced with a variety of hands, coverings, or functions. See Page 115 for list. Borgware: Stuff which fully replaces the majority of your body with cybernetic parts that are augmented by cyberoptics, audio, prosthesis, or other cyberware installations. See Page 116 for list. how to ReAD the CybeRwARe tAbles All Cyberware is defined by five factors: Name, Install, Data, Cost, and HL (Humanity Loss). Name: The popular street name of the cyberware. Install: Where you can get it put in. Installation surgery is always included at no extra charge, including at Character Generation. • Mall means you can literally get the installation done in any mall or street corner bio-mod shop; the equivalent of ear-piercing in the 1900s. There are not as many of these as there were in the 2020s. • Clinic means an actual Medtech in a medical surgery clinic. Most of the installation is automated, but it takes a skilled practitioner to use that gear. Most ripperdocs are at this level. • Hospital means the work requires major surgery and a Medtech capable of doing this kind of work. This also requires a full hospital or the nearest equivalent, which is relatively rare. The listings in this chapter are abbreviated. You'll find full rules for all cyberware starting on Page 358 111 PUTTING THE CYBER INTO THE PUNK Description & Data: A description of the cyberware, its game mechanics, its prerequisites, and what is known about it on The Street. Benefits from multiple installations of the same cyberware do not stack unless otherwise noted. For more detailed information about the item, go to page 358. Options Slots: Most classifications of cyberware have a foundational piece of cyberware that is a prerequisite for installing other cyberware of this type. This cyberware has a number of Option Slots that can be filled with other cyberware. Unless otherwise marked, most cyberware options require one slot in the foundational cyberware or of that category. If a type of cyberware requires a foundational piece it will be listed first with its Option Slots. In the case of Fashionware, Internal Cyberware, and External Cyberware, there is no foundational cyberware but you can still only implant 7 Option Slots worth of cyberware. Cost: What the cyberware costs in the main currency in Night City, the Eurobuck. The Price Category of the item is listed below its cost. See Buying and Selling on Page 385. HL (Humanity Loss): How badly this installation will affect your psyche. At Character Generation, Humanity Loss is preset. After Character Generation, Humanity Loss is determined by the dice in paren- theses following the preset number. ▶ FAshionwARe (7 oPtion slots AvAilAble) Name Install Description & Data Cost HL Biomonitor Mall Subdermal implant which generates a readout of vitals.

To find out what cyberware your Character comes equipped with, check the lists on the tables below and look under your Character's Role. Note that you may occasionally be given a choice between 2 or more options (example: Nasal Filter or Toxin Binders). Pick one and only one when offered an option. We have also worked out all the Humanity Loss costs (see pg. 111); subtract these from your current Humanity and see how this affects your EMP Statistic.

Starting to look over the list of cyberware and thinking: \"I don't have the kind of eurobucks I need to swing this tech,\"? At this point, you have to ask yourself: \"How desperate am I? Am I really hard up enough to risk death and dismemberment just to get a lousy cyberarm?\" Sure you are. The truly desperate turn to desperate measures.

Just because the truce is in place doesn't mean that there aren't lots of low-key national armies running around.

If you aren't an Exec, you won't be doing the job of an Exec, and if there's an Exec at the table, you'll be working under them alongside their team. However, if you are an Exec, you'll know this is the difference between just working for the Corporation and selling your soul to it. Forget about changing jobs.

If you're really lucky, you'll even get to be a grunt in the next Corporate war; you know, the ones that make Vietnam and the Russian engage- ment in Afghanistan look like picnics, defending the Corporation's interests in some backwater hellhole with a population of civilians you're suppressing. Restoring the Corporate Order is fun! the CAtCh Like most \"free\" offers, these employment opportunities are booby-trapped in creative and dangerous ways. Each requires that you work for an indeterminate amount of time (forever) for people you may not like. You'll have to do what they tell you, no matter how cruddy, dangerous, or suicidal. Like most powerful people in the Cyberpunk future, they don't like to be crossed, and have a variety of awful ways to ensure your \"cooperation\": Hostages: To ensure your good behavior, the con- trolling agency is holding someone you care about hostage. You mess up, they die—or worse. Blackmail: Somewhere in your past, you did some- thing you can't afford to let out. It could be as small as cheating on your taxes (with a 20-year jail term), or a murder rap. It may even be fictional—created by your new employers to make sure you toe the line. Are you willing to take the chance? Sabotage Cybernetics: To make sure you stay in line, the controlling agency has buried lethal glitches in your cybernetic software. Things to make your heart stop on command. Programs that give you blinding headaches if you refuse to follow an order. Monitored: Your employers have implanted sensors or other monitoring devices on you—just to ensure your loyalty. You can't say or do anything without them knowing. You can't go anywhere without them finding you. The worst part is, you don't know where in your body they've hidden these devices. Command Kill: A really vicious sabotage chip—on the command word, you'll kill whomever you are directed to kill; without control, regret or mercy. Your mother. Your lover. Your cat. Anyone. Company Safeguard: Another nasty sabotage chip. You can't willingly harm any member of the controlling agency; to do so causes you excruci- ating pain. To continue causes even more pain, culminating in full heart stoppage and a screaming death. Remote Detonator: One of the favorite Corporate tricks, this is a small package of inert explosive buried somewhere in your body, activated by a remote radio signal. You don't know where they put it, the scanners can't find it, and if you did go around looking you're likely to set it off. Wanna bet your life, choomba? Remember, if you join one of these groups, any one (or more) of these little goodies applies directly to making you a puppet of your employers. What you are forced to do, and what they hold over you, is up to the GM. They don't even have to tell you if you've been tampered with. You don't have a choice.

Here's some data on how to fill it out. 1. The big block on top's for drawing or affixing a picture of your Character. Beneath it, you'll find a box for recording your Character's Handle (street name), Role, Role Ability, and any notes you want to keep. 2. Write your STATs here. STATs that can have two different values (Maximum and Current) are divided in two by bar. 3. Your Derived Statistics are recorded here. That includes Humanity, Hit Points, your Seriously Wounded threshold, and Death Save value. You can also record any Critical Injuries or Addictions your Character suffers during play. 4. Skills go here. They're organized by category and note the STAT they're linked to. You can record your Skill Level, your STAT number, and your Skill Base (STAT + Skill combined). 5. This space is for your weapons and armor. For armor, you record SP and penalty. For Weapons, you can record damage, mag- azine size, Rate of Fire, and any notes like alternate fire modes. 6. You'll earn and spend Improvement Points to raise Skill Levels and Role Ability Ranks during play. This area also has a spot for recording Reputation information (see pg. 193). 7. Record the results of your general Lifepath here. 8. And record the results of your Role Specific Lifepath here. 9. This is where you keep track of your Outfit. At the bottom of the first section is a space for recording ammunition and cash. Beneath that you'll find spots for recording what Fashions you own and your current Housing and Lifestyle. 10. An entire page for cyberware! It is all divided by category and you can record name and what it does. There's additional instructions on the page.

Let's dance.\" Morgan Blackhand to Adam Smasher on top of arasaka towers just before the nuke went off The door of the trailer swings open and a young man in dark leathers, still dusty from the road, hauls himself into the air conditioned command truck. Humor glints from his eyes as light glints from the conchas on his hat and gun belt. A corned beef on rye is still half-eaten, clenched in his gunmetal grey fist. \"Evening, gatos y señoritas. The Aldecaldo— Santiago; he sends his regrets, but he has much to do now that the war is over. Many contracts for construc- tion, many wounded-and dead-to look after, including family. But he has sent we Lobos to help in any way we can.\" \"Well, well. Almost like old times, eh Johnny?\" Thompson runs the diagnostics on his FN-RAL one last time as he speaks. Camouflage green combat armor sits next to him, his camera already chipped into the helmet's control port. \"Not quite. We've got a lot better support than a thousand screaming fanboys this time!\" Rogue's grin quirks as she looks out at Shaitan's huge camouflaged form leaning against the massive self-propelled artil- lery unit parked next to their trailer. \"We may be res- cuing Alt, but the stakes are also a lot higher this time.\" A lot higher? Johnny's eyes are calm, but the Hand clenches and unclenches like it's possessed. \"She's been running loose through Arasaka's main- frames for a decade,\" grunts Thompson. \"Stands to reason her luck was going to run out sooner or later. Last thing we need is that thing she created loose in the NET after Rache's fallout.\" Johnny stands, looks out into the night. Finally, he says, \"Tonight.\" \"Tonight, Arasaka Tower falls. For the last time.\" I NTO THE MAELSTROM \"Well?\" \"Johnny? I have a request: will you stop pacing and stand still and stop asking 'well' every minute? Shaitan and I will have the door open when we have it open. This isn't like popping the lock on a CHOOH 2-4U.\" Spider goes back to work on decrypting the access codes on the door alarms while Shaitan, the full-body borg, bypasses the physical systems. Johnny sits on his haunches, waiting. Time passes. Spider looks up from her work, distracted by Johnny's pacing. \"You changed your hair.\" \"I do that,\" replies Johnny absently. \"You cut your braid.\" Spider ignores him. Then; \"And... we've... got it! All right. The door's bypassed!\" Johnny stands up, the Gun ready. \"Okay! Shaitan, you drew short straw, so you're first in!\" The borg nods and lifts his gun pod. \"Right. See you in Valhalla if they've been lying to us!\" Shaitan cracks open the door, scanning it with a remote extension, then flings the door open, whipping his gun pod up in a smooth motion and firing off two quick shots from the grenade launcher. \"Sorry about that. Autogun in the far corner, camera in the other. Taken care of.\" \"Well, if that's all, let's get to work. Spider, the com- puters are in the next room. Everyone else, secure the perimeter, and let's get those demolitions charges set up.\" Johnny strides into the room as if it were a stage and not a secret lab. Of course, it's probably the same to him, Spider thinks as she jacks her heavily shielded deck into the console before her. <Hello Alt.> <What, who's there . . . Spider?> <Yep. 'My name's Luke Skywalker. I'm here to rescue you.'> <What?> <Corny old flatvid Rache made me watch one day. > <Where's Rache? I thought he'd be riding point on any rescue.> <Rache is dead, Alt. Arasaka found his conapt... and... dropped a rock on it from orbit.> <Oh my god. Spider, I'm so sorry.> <Yeah, me too.> And Arasaka will be too, Spider silently vows. 122 THE FALL OF THE TOWERS \"Spider, are you almost done? Is she there? Is she okay?\" \"Chill, Johnny! Yes, I've found her and I've dumped her into the memory core. Now I'm releasing a recursive virus to wipe out all mention of the Soulkiller program.\" \"And?\" \"Well, it should remove every trace of evidence, at least electronic, that the Soulkiller ever existed. It's sort of like what Facemen use to erase an identity, only more general. Now give me some space.\" \"Make it fast. They've got to know we're here.\" Johnny steps back out to the outer lab, scanning for signs of trouble, which gives Spider time to walk over and download the last of the datachips. Then she closes down her deck and joins him outside talking to that Media, Thompson. \"What're those?\" Thompson asks, his cyberoptic scanning the datachips Spider tucks into a pocket. \"Information on the development team,\" she says, \"records on external Net access from the router, basic stuff. So we can track down the bastards who wrote this and check for any offline storage sites!\" It isn't, she reflects, completely a lie. After all, she does have that information, tucked away on the first chip. It's the other ones that contain her ace in the hole... And then everything goes sideways. D EATHS HEAD DANCE \"Going somewhere?\" Adam Smasher's voice cuts through the silent offices like a bullet crack. Someone screams, \"Cover!\" as machine gun and shotgun fire from Arasaka troopers spray through the narrow hallway, cutting three of the team's SpecOps troops in half. Spider scrambles behind a heavy pillar, as Rogue and Johnny take up position behind office furniture wholly inadequate for the job of stopping heavy fire. Spider watches Shaitan simply fade into near invisibility against a wall. Rogue pops off a burst from her rifle, then fires two grenades. The Aras seem to want the lab intact and aren't using heavy weapons. Team Alpha is under no such constraint. Shaitan fires off blast after blast from the portable cannon he calls a shotgun, but is tagged by an autogun burst that sends him rolling. People on both sides spasm and fall as high-velocity death fills the entire floor of the building. Somewhere, Spider hears Thompson scream in pain. Things are bad. There are too damn many of them—plus that damned borg. Time to make a deci- sion. Bullets chip at her cover while she hurriedly links her cyberdeck into the heavy suitcase memory stash carrying Alt. No time to double-check, no time to confirm links or space available. She launches herself into the NET, dragging the linked ICONS that repre- sent Alt's personality, memories, and whatever else it is that makes her different from an expert system. All Alt has, she thinks, is a hope and a prayer. Here goes nothing. 123 THE FALL OF THE TOWERSBY NEIL BRANQUINHO With a virtual 'toss', Spider fires the various portions of Alt out into the NET, tagging them with a marker so that she can maybe retrieve them someday and, if she gets lucky enough, re-rezz them back into her second-best, now first-best, friend. On the other side of the room, Johnny crouches under a desk, fighting with his past between bursts of gunfire. I left Alt last time. Just abandoned her. Not again. Never again. Better to burn out, says the Hand. Yeah, Johnny says to himself—and he knows what he has to do. Spider spends just a few seconds in the NET—an eternity and never enough time. She comes back to find her cover still getting powdered, although the cacophony has diminished. She sees Rogue discarding her empty rifle and pulling two heavy pistols. Spider draws her own flechette pistol, its heavy weight somehow comforting in her hand. Suddenly, Johnny's voice rings out, not in song but in challenge. \"Hey, Steelhead! Let's Rock and Roll!\" Johnny is standing in plain sight, a Militech SMG in one hand, the Malorian in the other. He begins pumping out rounds at Adam. Adam turns, but hesitates, astonished at the audac- ity of the Rockerboy, challenging him with weapons that won't even crease his cyborged armor. An arm comes up. The autoshotgun in it opens fire. APDS rounds cut the young rocker in half. Johnny spins and falls to the ground, a surprised look on his face, the Malorian still smoking in his Fist. It only takes a second. But a second is all Shaitan needs. He seems to emerge from the wall behind Adam and grapples with him. Seeing an opening, Rogue and Spider react as one. Rogue stands, bullets streaming from her pistols like tears, raking down Arasaka troopers. Spider sits up and fires, picking Ara targets and putting them down, one shot after another. It's all just a V-sim, she says to herself. Just a game. Just a game. Adam lurches around, but Shaitan's grip is that of desperation. Spider sees that Shaitan' s right arm hangs shattered and limp at his side, blasted by a grenade. It's only a matter of seconds before Adam gets free and takes them all down. \"Get out of here! I've got him!\" Shaitan's hollow metallic voice bellows at the two women. The rest of the Aras are down, but so are the SpecOps. Rogue, Spider, and a crippled Thompson are alone with the two battling borgs. They can hear more soldiers coming. They know they have no choice. As Spider moves to the Rockerboy's mangled form, Rogue grabs her arm, her hard eyes boring into Spider's own. \"Johnny's dead, Spider. Help me get Thompson out of here.\" Rogue's eyes speak of certainty and incred- ible pain, all slammed away behind an iron will to survive. Keep the meat baggage light, Rache used to say. Spider reaches inside her jacket. She pulls out the data slug Alt downloaded to her so long ago. It's surprisingly heavy. She whispers, Sorry, Johnny, as she rams it home into the back of the dying rocker's skull. Then she turns, reaches out for the data suitcase, but sees that it, too, has been savaged by gunfire; it's wrecked. Two friends down in as many minutes. She quietly wishes Alt good luck. \"Spider, now!\" But at least Johnny will be avenged, Spider thinks as she and Rogue drag the wounded Thompson to the elevator. She softly touches the remaining datachips in her pocket. And so will Rache. 124 THE FALL OF THE TOWERS 125 BY HUNTANG Getting it doneGetting it done the basics of resolutionthe basics of resolution \"Spend enough time on The Street and you'll learn talk is cheap. When your AV's busted up and you're about to fall outta the sky or when you need to find a fence before the Corp cops break down your door. A big mouth ain't gonna help you. Edgerunners let their actions speak for them. Put up or shut up.\" Hornet fixer 126 GETTING IT DONE G etting the Scene Down There are a few basic rules to this mental landscape. First, if your Character can see something with the naked eye or the scope of a weapon, you can interact with it. If there's anything in the way, it's considered to be blocked and you can't interact with it. If it's posi- tioned forward of your shoulders, you can face it and possibly interact with it. Last, if it's within your reach (2 m/yds), you can also touch it; otherwise, you'll need to use a longer tool, weapon, or some other method to extend your reach. That brings us to the subject of measurement. In Cyberpunk RED, we measure everything in both meters or yards (and treat them interchangeably; the difference is only about 2 inches). One reason we do this is that it means we don't have to change measurements around between Metric and English systems. It also corresponds pretty well to a generic 6-foot Character. If you are using a grid and miniatures, each 1-inch square corresponds to 2 meters/yards DistAnCe AnD movement As a rule, there are three scales of movement used in Cyberpunk RED. ▶ Narrative Movement ◀ The first scale is narrative movement. This means movement that is described in real-world terms as part of the narrative of a story. For example, cars move at miles or kilometers per hour, walking is measured in similar, but smaller, distances. For most game pur- poses, we classify these types of movement by cate- gories. Below, you can find the movement categories for the average human. In the Vehicle Combat section on pg. 189 you can find the narrative speeds of the various vehicles. Travel Method MPH KPH Walking 2.5 4 Running 5 11 ▶ Figurative Movement ◀ The second scale is Figurative Movement: com- paring one MOVE STAT to another MOVE STAT to see who is faster overall. This is best for simple sus- tained speed contests, like the outcome of a footrace. This is where you compare the Lamborghini to the Volkswagen; one has a higher MOVE STAT than the other, and this is used as a basis of comparison. ▶ Literal Movement ◀ Finally, there's Literal Movement: a measurement of actual distance, used in combat and when using miniatures. Every Turn, a Character gets a Move Action, which can only be used to move a number of m/yds equal to their MOVE x 2, or a number of squares equal to their MOVE, which can include moving diagonally. Move Actions, along with all other Actions a Character can do on a Turn are explained later in the On Your Turn Section on pg. 127. time AnD initiAtive Cyberpunk RED uses two ways of measuring time. The first, Roleplaying Time, works just like it does in real life. The second, Combat Time, is far more exacting. Combat Time is divided into Turns, each of which takes approximately 3 seconds. The amount of time it takes each entity involved in the combat to take a Turn is a Round. Because Actions happen roughly simultaneously in game, one Round is also approximately 3 seconds long. ▶ Initiative ◀ But who gets to go first? For that, we need to deter- mine Initiative; basically, a Character's place in \"line\" relative to everyone else doing something in the Turn. The \"line\" is what we call an Initiative Queue; a mental lineup of who goes when. When a combat starts, everyone rolls Initiative: Your Initiative Value = REF + 1d10 You'll find the full rules for combat in the Friday Night Firefight chapter on Page 167 127 GETTING IT DONE All participants in the combat place themselves according to their Initiative result into the Initiative Queue in descending order from highest score to lowest score. Resolve ties by rolling again. Combat proceeds in Initiative Queue order, with each entity in the Initiative Queue getting a Turn. When the bottom is reached, the Initiative Queue is repeated from the top in the same order. on youR tuRn Every Turn, a Character gets one Move Action and one Action. In this section we will describe the most common Actions in brief. In the Friday Firefight Section (on pg. 167) we will give you a more in-depth, full list of Actions. Many of those Actions will only happen during or directly after a combat. Your Turn = 1 Move Action + 1 Action ▶ ACtions in bRieF Move Action Move up to as many m/yds as your MOVE Statistic x 2 each Turn. Attack Make a Melee or Ranged Attack. Get into a Vehicle Get into a vehicle. Get Up Stand after being Prone. Grab Grab and hold an opponent or take away an object they are holding. Hold Action Hold an Action until later in the Round. Run Take an additional Move Action. Stabilize Stabilize a target to begin the natural healing process. Starting a Vehicle Start a vehicle. Throw Throw a grabbed opponent to the ground or throw an object. Use NET Actions Perform multiple Actions inside the NET. Use an Object Manipulate an object in a way that doesn't require a Skill Use a Skill Use one of your Skills to accomplish a quick task. ▶ Actions in Detail ◀ ▶ move ACtion Every Turn, a Character gets a Move Action, which can only be used to move a number of m/yds equal to their MOVE x 2, or a number of squares equal to their MOVE, which can include moving diagonally. ▶ AttACk Use an Action to make an attack with Ranged Combat or Melee Combat. Check out the Combat System (pg. 167) for information on how to make an attack. ▶ Get into A vehiCle Use an Action to get into an unlocked vehicle or a vehicle you have the physical/biometric key for. ▶ Get uP Use an Action to get up from being on the floor (aka Prone). While Prone you cannot use a Move Action until you first use this Action. ▶ GRAb Grab and hold someone, take an object they are carrying, or escape a grapple. Check out the Combat System (pg. 177) for information on how to grapple people. ▶ holD ACtion In combat, a Character can use this Action to Hold off on one specific Action until a designated number in the Initiative Queue comes up, or a specified event occurs. When that time comes, they can choose to either go through with their chosen Action or forgo it entirely. You can’t Hold an Action across multiple Rounds. You can’t change your mind about when the action triggers, either. Move Actions and NET Actions cannot be Held at all. ▶ Run Use an Action to take an additional Move Action. If you can't use a Move Action right now, you can't use this Action. 128 GETTING IT DONE ▶ stAbiliZe Use an Action to stabilize a target to begin the natural healing process or pull them out of the Mortally Wounded Wound State to save their life. For more on stabilization and healing see pg. 222. ▶ stARtinG A vehiCle Use an Action to start a vehicle that you are already in. This requires the physical/biometric key for the vehicle. Check out the Vehicle Combat System (pg. 189) for information on car chases. ▶ thRow Throw a person you are grappling or an object you are holding. Check out the Combat System (pg. 177) for information on how to throw items and people. ▶ use net ACtions Use an Action to make multiple NET Action such as running Programs. Only a Netrunner can make use of NET Actions, which they can take instead of another Action on their Turn. NET Actions are covered in the Netrunning Section (pg. 197). ▶ use A skill Use an Action to use one of your Skills to attempt to accomplish a quick task (3 seconds max). If the GM determines your proposed task would take more than 3 seconds, and you still want to do it, you can spend your Action every Turn to attempt to accomplish it, at a rate of 3 seconds per Turn, making your Check only when you've finished the duration of the task. Task resolution is covered in Resolving Actions with Skills later on this page. ▶ use An obJeCt Use this Action as a catch-all for using/manipulating/ picking up an object in ways that wouldn't require using a Skill and aren't covered by other Actions, but would still require a quick 3 seconds of effort. Use this for things like opening up a door, switching your held shotgun out for an assault rifle slung on your back, picking up an unattended weapon off the floor, pressing the button on a detonator, or biting into a slice of pizza. If the GM determines your proposed task would take more than 3 seconds, and you still want to do it, you can spend your Action every Turn to attempt to accomplish it, at a rate of 3 seconds per Turn. Drawing an easily accessible weapon isn't an Action if you have a free hand. R esolving Actions with Skills whAt is A skill? A Skill is something your Character knows how to do thanks to their training. The level of your Skill rep- resents how trained your Character is in that activity. Each Skill is linked to a STAT that represents natural ability. That's why you add STAT + Skill together on a Skill Check. This creates your Skill Base.BY SEBASTIAN SZMYD 129 GETTING IT DONE skill CheCk Resolution Whenever your Character tries to do something, there's always the question of whether they'll succeed or fail. Sometimes the task is so easy that it's obvious; for instance, taking a step forward without falling. In those cases, tell the GM what you're doing, and no die roll is needed. But if you're trying to take a step on the deck of a ship pitching wildly in a driving rainstorm, walking might be very difficult indeed. These are the situations that call for a Skill Check. There are two ways to resolve Skill Checks: The first is to resolve your Skill against another living thing or person's Skill (like trying to persuade someone to do some- thing for you). To do this, you, the Attacker, add your relevant STAT + Skill + 1d10 die roll against your opponent, the Defender's own relevant STAT + Skill + 1d10 die roll. The result of your opponent's STAT + Skill + 1d10 die roll is also known as the Difficulty Value, or DV, the amount your STAT + Skill + 1d10 will need to beat in order for you to succeed. In case of a tie, the Defender always wins. examPLe acTions During a fast break in a pickup basketball game Gina finds herself as the last line of defense on her team guarding against a young upstart. The upstart jumps up for a fadeaway and Gina leaps up to block his shot. This is an Opposed Skill Check. Gina and the young upstart both roll DEX + Athletics + 1d10, and both come up with a 14! So, who wins? Gina does, because she is the defender, and so she slaps the ball down with panache. Later during the basket- ball game, Gina breaks the backboard during a par- ticularly impressive dunk. She stays after the game to repair the damage. Since the broken backboard isn't an adversary, this isn't handled as an Opposed Skill Check. Instead, she makes the Check against a Difficulty Value (DV). The GM determines that repairing the backboard is an Everyday feat, and so assigns it a DV13. Gina rolls TECH + Basic Tech + 1d10, and gets 14 as a result, beating the DV, and repairing the backboard. Attacker's STAT + Skill + 1d10 vs. Defender's STAT + Skill + 1d10 The second way is resolving your Skill against the difficulty of a situation (like picking a lock or driving a car). The GM determines how long the task you want to perform will take and uses the table below to decide which rating best describes the difficulty to perform the task, the Difficulty Value (DV). Then you add your STAT + Skill + 1d10 and try to beat the Difficulty Value (DV) the GM assigned to the task you want to perform. Attacker's STAT + Skill + 1d10 vs. Difficulty Value (DV) ▶ DiFFiCulty vAlues (Dv) Difficulty Description DV Simple This is something most people can do without thinking, but which might be hard for a small child. 9 Everyday This feat is something most people can do without a lot of special training. 13 Difficult This feat is difficult to accomplish without training or natural talent. 15 Professional This feat takes actual training and the user can be considered to be a professional, skilled in their abilities. 17 Heroic This is a highly skilled feat; one that only the best of the best can pull off. This is the level of sports stars and other highly regarded superstars. 21 Incredible This is a tremendous feat. Pulling this off would rate you among the very best of your class professionally. You are of truly Olympian mettle. 24 Legendary An awe-inspiring feat. This is something people write stories about; a truly amazing accomplishment that will be spoken of in hushed tones for years to come. 29 130 GETTING IT DONE ▶ Critical Success ◀ When you roll a natural 10 on your d10, you've scored a Critical Success. Roll another 1d10 and add the result to your first roll. If you roll another 10, you do not score another Critical Success. ▶ Critical Failure ◀ When you roll a natural roll of 1 on your d10, you've scored a Critical Failure. Roll another 1d10 and sub- tract the result from your STAT + Skill + the first roll. If you roll another 1, you do not score another Critical Failure. ▶ Modifying the Attempt ◀ Sometimes conditions beyond your control may make it harder to perform a task. For example, a Simple (DV9) Skill Check is a whole order of magnitude tougher during an earthquake. These external condi- tions are called Modifiers. When the GM decides a Modifier applies to your Skill Check, you will subtract the Modifier Value from your roll. Here are some typical examples of conditions that might cause your GM to call for Modifiers (they are cumulative). ▶ neGAtive moDiFieR exAmPles Condition Mod Value Night or low lighting conditions -1 Have never done this before -1 Complex task -2 Don't have right tools or parts -2 Slept uncomfortable the night before. -2 Under extreme stress -2 Exhausted -4 Extremely drunk or sedated -4 Trying to perform task secretly -4 Task obscured by smoke, darkness -4 ▶ Trying Again ◀ If you fail a Skill Check, you can't try again unless your chances of success have improved for some reason— you took longer, used a better tool, or you (or one of your friends) made a Complementary Skill Check. ▶ Complementary Skills ◀ Complementary Skill Checks are where the use of one Skill directly affects the use of a subsequent Skill. At the GM's discretion, a good roll in one Skill (which can even be rolled by another Character) may confer a +1 bonus to the subsequent use of a related Skill, so long as the complementary nature of the two Skills makes sense. This +1 bonus only affects a subsequent attempt once, and Complementary Skill bonuses do not stack. ▶ Taking Extra Time ◀ Taking Extra Time can also give you a bonus to your Skill Check. When the GM tells you how long a task will take to complete, you can get a single +1 bonus to your Skill Check for taking four times longer. ▶ When You Don't Have A Skill ◀ When you just don't have a Skill to use, but you want to try anyway, you have one option: Simply use the STAT that the Skill you don't have is linked to and add it to 1d10. That's all you get. You are relying purely on your STAT. ▶ Using Your LUCK ◀ Before you roll, you can dedicate a portion of your remaining LUCK Pool (which holds LUCK Points equal to your LUCK Statistic, and which refills at the beginning of each game session) to a Check, which increases the roll by +1 for each point in your LUCK Pool that you expended. LUCK is a powerful force that can allow the otherwise impossible to become attainable. Simple? Remember: to do pretty much anything in Cyberpunk RED, simply combine a STAT, a Skill, and a d10 roll against a Difficulty Value (DV). If your Check is over that amount, you did it! Everything else is just window dressing! S kill List Below you can find a list of all the Skills used in Cyberpunk RED. To give you a concept of what these Skills can do at different levels, each description includes breakdowns of commonly achievable tasks at different Skill Bases. Skills marked (x2) cost twice as much to purchase and improve. Positive Modifiers generally come from gear, cyberware, Role Abilities, or drugs. A Skill Base is the appropriate STAT + Skill combined as a single number. Despite the name, a highly skilled Character can actually succeed after a Critical Failure and a high DV can still defeat a Character who achieves a Critical Success. 131 GETTING IT DONE AwAReness skills Concentration .....................................

R ole Abilities roleS and role abilitieS in the time of the red In the 2020s, Roles were basically the \"job\" your Character had. Roles defined what they did, but not what they were. But in the Time of the Red, the lack of structure and steady \"jobs\" means that a Role is more of a self-defining label. You don't \"do Solo stuff.\" You are a Solo—it's what defines you no matter what you do. No one in the Time of the Red pays you to punch a clock as a Solo— instead you look for gigs that are the kind of gigs a Solo would do. In short, in the Time of the Red you are your own boss and your Role is your personal job description. But since you are new to The Street, you're not start- ing at the top. Nope, you're starting near the bottom. Starting Characters automatically begin their Role Ability at Rank 4 (unless the GM of your particular game decides to allow you to start at 143 GETTING IT DONE a higher Rank). On The Street, Rank 4 means you aren't a total weefle; you know where the dangerous end of the gun is, and you can at least play \"Chippin' In\" on your axe. But you're starting to make your bones in a dangerous world and people are just now willing to take a chance on your abilities. So, don't mess it up, yo. You can find Role Abilities by Role on the following pages: meDiA PAGe 151 exeC PAGe 153 lAwmAn PAGe 158 FixeR PAGe 159 nomAD PAGe 161 meDteCh PAGe 149 teCh PAGe 147 solo PAGe 146 RoCkeRboy PAGe 144 multiClAssinG Roles You can't start off taking on two Roles at once. Much in the same way that people in the real world have to throw themselves into a career just to make it work, your Role is just that—a full time career. It's going to take everything you have just to make it in one area of The Street, so don't get cocky, punk. That being said, there's nothing stopping you from starting one Role \"career\" and then swapping to another one. In real life, people do that all the time. In the Time of the Red, you can change Roles anytime you have completed at least 4 Ranks in your previous Role by buying Rank 1 in the new Role with Improvement Points. You then start the new Role at Rank 1, just mastering the intricacies of your new career. When you switch, you'll be locked from multiclassing again until your latest Role is at least Rank 4. Meanwhile, you can also continue increasing the Rank of your previous Role, and you retain all features granted by it, but to The Street you will now be seen as your new Role as you concentrate on mastering the ropes. muLTicLassinG examPLe Jay's been playing in a long running Cyberpunk RE D cam p aign an d has banked quite a few Improvement Points. A few sessions back his Solo, JP Guyver, was adopted by the Gargoyles, a Nomad pack in the Blood Nation. To reflect this, he decides to multi- class from Solo to Nomad. JP's Solo Role Ability, Combat Awareness is Rank 4, which means the jump to Nomad is per- fectly legal. Jay spends the Improvement Points needed and purchases the Nomad Role Ability, Moto, at Rank 1. He picks a ground bike as his first vehicle. From this point on, Jay can spend Improvement Points to increase either of JP's Role Abilities, Combat Awareness or Moto. If, down the road, he wants to adopt a third Role (maybe JP Guyver starts arranging jobs as a Fixer), he'll need to buy his Nomad Role Ability, Moto, to Rank 4 first. netRunneR PAGe 147 144 GETTING IT DONE ChARismAtiC imPACt (RoCkeRboy Role Ability) The Rockerboy has the Role ability Charismatic Impact.

When a Rockerboy wants to make use of their Charismatic Impact on a fan or group of fans, the GM uses the table below to determine if the favor is something within the powers of their Charismatic Impact given their current Role Ability Rank.

He hits his favorite bar in the Combat Zone. When he arrives, he works the scene, being the sociable guy that he is, and the GM lets him know that the bartender is already a fan of his, which isn't surprising to Rico. Later that night, a bachelorette party visits the bar, lured by the novelty of drinking in such a dangerous part of the city, and Rico intro- duces himself to them. As he meets the small group, he rolls 4 (his Charismatic Impact Rank) + 1d10 vs. a DV10 to impress them. Succeeding, he turns them into his fans. Rico decides it would be a great time to really get this party started. He calls over one of the bartenders, and asks the single fan to do him a major favor and hook the bachelorette party up with a bottle of his favorite tequila, which happens to be the good stuff they keep behind the bar to protect it from errant bullets. He rolls 4 (his Charismatic Impact Rank) + 1d10 vs. DV10, and burns some LUCK just to make sure. It's a success, and the good times roll all night, granting Rico the stress relief he needed. 146 GETTING IT DONE CombAt AwAReness (solo Role Ability) When combat begins (before Initiative is rolled), anytime outside of combat, or in combat with an Action, a Solo may divide the total number of points they have in their Combat Awareness Role Ability among the following abilities.

Add your Rank in this Specialty to any Basic Tech, Cybertech, Electronics/Security Tech, Weaponstech, Land, Sea, or Air Vehicle Tech Skill Check you make for any Non-Maker Specialty purpose. Additionally, as long as you have at least 1 Rank in this specialty, instead of attempting a lengthy full repair you can elect to instead temporarily repair your target (at the same DV of a typical repair for the item) to perfect condition as an Action (with full SP and HP, if applicable). You add your Rank in Field Expertise to this Check. This jury-rigging holds for 10 minutes for each Rank you have in this specialty, after which the item returns to the state it was in before you jury-rigged it, except that it cannot be jury-rigged again until it has been fully repaired. 148 GETTING IT DONE ▶ uPGRADe exPeRtise Improves an item in one of the following ways. An item can only benefit from 1 upgrade granted by this specialty. • Lower the Humanity Loss of non-borgware cyberware by 1d6 if its typical humanity loss would be 2d6 or greater. • Increase the number slots of a type an item already has for options, attachments, Programs/Hardware, etc. by one. • Simplify the item, halving the time it takes to make any future full repair to the item. • Grant a typically non-concealable one- handed weapon the ability to be concealed. • Increase an Average Quality Weapon to an Excellent Quality Weapon. • Grant a weapon Attachment Slot to an Exotic Weapon. • Allow an Exotic Weapon to fire one variety of Non-Basic Ammunition of its ammunition type. • Increase an item's SP by 1, but only if it had any to begin with. • Upgrade a vehicle with an upgrade that only requires a Nomad Role Ability Rank of 1. • Install an upgrade invented by the Tech using Invention Expertise. Requires additional mate- rials equal to the Price Category assigned to the item by the GM when it was invented. To upgrade an item, you roll TECH + the TECH Skill that the item is typically repaired with + your Rank in this specialty + 1d10. The Tech must purchase materials of the same price category of the item being upgraded, which installing the upgrade consumes. The DV you roll against and the time it takes to install the upgrade is based on the price category of the item you are upgrading. The one exception is vehicle upgrades, which are treated as being 1,000eb (Very Expensive) for this purpose. On a failed Check, halfway through the upgrade, you realize that you'll have to start again from scratch. The materials purchased to make the upgrade and the item to be upgraded are both uninjured. ▶ FAbRiCAtion exPeRtise Fabricate an existing item or one invented by the Tech using Invention Expertise from materials. To make an item, you roll TECH + the TECH Skill that the item is typically repaired with + your Rank in this specialty + 1d10. The Tech must purchase materials of one price category lower than the price category of the item being fabricated. (Except for Super Luxury items, which require materials equal to half their Price to fabricate.) The DV you roll against and the time it takes to make the item is based on the price category of the item you are making. On a failed Check, halfway through the fabrication process, you realize that you'll have to start again from scratch. The materials purchased to make the item are uninjured. ▶ invention exPeRtise Invent an upgrade to an existing item or invent an entirely new item. To invent an item/upgrade, you'll need to describe to your GM the desired function of your item/ upgrade, as precisely as you can in the language of already existing technologies in the setting, making sure to include the mechanism by which your invention might accomplish its function. It is suggested that you draw up a simple schematic for illustrative purposes. Your GM and fellow Players will certainly appreciate it. If your GM is satisfied with your explanation and is okay with it in their game, they will write how the proposed invention would operate rules-wise, being careful not to create an imbalanced item.

Based on the item or upgrade's value if it were to be sold on the open market, the GM will set the Price Category of the item as close to other items/upgrades of a similar \"power level\" as possible, although the lowest cate- gory they can select is Expensive. The time it will take to invent the item/upgrade and the DV your Character has to beat with their TECH + the TECH Skill associated with repairing the invention or the item the invention is meant to upgrade + your Rank in this specialty + 1d10. The DV you roll against and the time it takes to make the item is based on the price category of the item you are making. On a failed Check, you realize halfway through your process that you need to go back to the drawing board. Once invented, you (or another Tech who you show the blueprints to) can make your invented item/ upgrade real using Fabrication or Upgrade Expertise! It's worth mentioning that nobody will give your inven- tion a second thought before you have a working prototype. Of course, that's when they'll try to steal it. Don't bother with the courts. More than any ability in the game, this ability can result in game imbalance. Your GM might need to retroactively change the way your invention operates rules-wise (or, in extreme circumstances, even replace it with another invention of an equal price category that you collaborate on together) several times before you find a version that works well at your table and doesn't negatively impact game balance. ▶ uPGRADe/FAbRiCAte/invent Dv/time Cost DV Time Cheap/Everyday 9 1 hour Costly 13 6 hours Premium 17 1 day Expensive 21 1 week Very Expensive 24 2 weeks Luxury 29 1 month Super Luxury 29 1 month per 10,000eb of Cost. meDiCine (meDteCh Role Ability) Medtechs keep people alive who should be dead with their knowledge and training. In the Time of the Red, they are as much mechanics as they are doctors, caring for people who are oftentimes more machine than human. The Medtech Role Ability is Medicine. Whenever the Medtech increases their Medicine Rank, they also choose one of the following three Medicine Specialties (Surgery, Medical Tech [Pharmaceuticals], or Medical Tech [Cryosystem Operation]) to allocate 1 point to. The Medical Section contains additional uses for both the Surgery and Medical Tech Skills, which are only available to Medtechs through this Role Ability (See pg. 226). These include Cyberware installation and harvesting, Bodysculpting, and Therapy! ▶ suRGeRy For every point you allocate to Surgery, you gain 2 points in the Surgery Skill (up to a maximum of 10). The Surgery Skill is the TECH Skill used to treat the most severe Critical Injuries, as well as implant cyber- ware, and is only available to Medtechs through this Medicine Specialty. ▶ meDiCAl teCh (PhARmACeutiCAls) For every point you allocate to Medical Tech (Pharmaceuticals), you gain 1 point in the Medical Tech Skill (up to a maximum of 10). The Medical Tech Skill is the TECH Skill used to operate, understand, and repair (as other non-vehicle Tech Skills) medical machinery. This Skill is only available to Medtechs, and only through either this Medicine Specialty or Cryosystem Operation. You can only put a maximum of 5 points into this specialty. Each time you allocate a point into Pharmaceuticals you also gain access to one of the following phar- maceuticals, which your Character can synthesize by rolling a DV13 Medical Tech Check, wasting the materials used on a failure. A Medtech can make a number of doses from 200eb of materials equal to their Medical Tech Skill in 1 hour. You can't synthesize Street Drugs with Medical Tech (Pharmaceuticals). Your Medical Tech Skill Level equals your points in Pharmaceuticals plus your points in CryoSystem Operation. 150 GETTING IT DONE Pharmaceutical Effect Antibiotic When injected with a dose of Antibiotic, a target who has already started the natural healing process heals an extra 2 Hit Points every day for a week. A person can only benefit from one use of Antibiotic at a time. Rapidetox When injected with a dose of Rapidetox, a target who is affected by a drug, poison, or intoxicant is immediately purged of the effects of that substance. Speedheal When injected with a dose of Speedheal, a target who is not in the Mortally Wounded Wound State immediately heals an amount of HP equal to their BODY + WILL. A person can only benefit from one use of Speedheal per day. Stim When injected with a dose of Stim, a target can ignore all penalties from being in the Seriously Wounded Wound State for an hour. A person can only benefit from one use of Stim per day. Surge When injected with a dose of Surge, a target can function unimpaired without sleep for a full 24 hours. A person can only benefit from one use of Surge per week. Applying a single dose of a drug to a target takes an Action. If the target is unwilling, the Medtech can use their Action to attempt to make a single Melee Weapon Attack with their Airhypo against the target, that administers a single dose to their target on a hit instead of dealing damage. A Character who is not a Medtech cannot administer Pharmaceuticals correctly. These aren't Street Drugs, they require training to get the medically correct proportions. ▶ meDiCAl teCh (CRyosystem oPeRAtion) For every point you allocate to Medical Tech (Cryosystem Operation), you gain 1 point in the Medical Tech Skill (up to a maximum of 10). The Medical Tech Skill is the TECH Skill used to operate, understand, and repair (as other non-vehicle Tech Skills) medical machinery. This Skill is only available to Medtechs, and only through either this Medicine Specialty or Pharmaceuticals. You can only put a maximum of 5 points into this specialty. When you allocate points into Cryosystem Operation you also gain a benefit as detailed below: Level Benefit 1 With 1 point in Cryosystem Operation you gain one Cryopump. 2 With 2 points in Cryosystem Operation you become a Registered Cryotank Technician and gain unlimited 24/7 access to 1 Cryotank at a time at any cryotank facility operated by medical corporations or government agencies. 3 With 3 points in Cryosystem Operation you gain 1 Cryotank, installed in a room of your choosing. 4 With 4 points in Cryosystem Operation you gain 2 more Cryotanks that can fit in the same room as your first one and your Cryopump has 2 charges and its maximum carrying capacity increases to 2 people in stasis. 5 With 5 points in Cryosystem Operation you gain 3 more Cryotanks that can fit in the same room as the first three and your Cryopump has 3 charges and its maximum carrying capacity increases to three people in stasis. You'll find more information on Cryopumps and Cryotanks on page 353. 151 GETTING IT DONE CReDibility (meDiA Role Ability) The Media Role Ability is Credibility. The Media not only can convince an audience of what they publish, but also has a larger audience the more credible they are. They also have greater levels of access to sources and information. Medias are also in the know and pick up on rumors passively. ▶ Rumors ◀ Medias are deeply plugged into information networks. Assuming you aren't entirely off-grid, at least twice per week the GM will secretly roll Your Credibility Rank + 1d10. If the Check beats any of the DVs on the Rumor Table's Passive column, the GM will clue the Media in on the highest DV rumor which their Check beat. These are the same rumors that a Media might find by hitting The Street during gameplay using their relevant information gathering skills like Library Search, Conversation, or Interrogation. When a Media is actively looking for a rumor like this, they roll appropriate STAT + relevant Skill + 1d10 against the DV on the Active column the GM has set for the rumor based on how detailed it is. Rumor Description Passive DV Active DV Vague Rumor The rumor is hazy. It contains the bare minimum of information required to start hunting down the supposed truth at the core of it. 7 13 Typical Rumor The rumor is enough to know where to go next in an investigation. It contains enough information to get a passing glimpse at the supposed truth at the core of it. 9 15 Substantial Rumor As Typical Rumor, but the rumor additionally contains concrete information that is beneficial to a potential investigation, like names, places, and times. 11 17 Detailed Rumor As Substantial Rumor, but the rumor additionally contains information that, if verified, could become a piece of evidence the Media can use in a story they might publish about the supposed truth at the core of the rumor. 13 21 Rumors, by definition, are often untrue, and are never the full story. Finding that is your job. Remember, some threads are dangerous to pull. ▶ Publishing Stories or Scoops ◀ Access/Sources represents those you can reasonably get in touch with/interview or otherwise gain information from. Audience is how many people your stories or exposés can reach. Believability is how well your story or exposé goes over with your audience. The higher your Credibility, the more likely people will believe something you have written or broadcast. You roll 1d10 based on your Believability when you publish a story and any time you want to find out whether an individual (or a group of individuals) credibiLiTy has a biG imPacT Credibility is a powerful tool, and will have a big impact on the story of any campaign. Corporate guards can be easily and painlessly replaced, but at higher Ranks of Credibility, a Media can make a Corporation feel real hurt by going to the wall to get the truth. They may retaliate, but when you document it in your next tell-all book, they'll feel even more pain. Armed with Credibility, if they can't discredit you, and they can't silence you, and you won't cut a deal, and you won't go away, you can make real change. As a Media, it's within your powers to give even a bad story a good ending. 152 GETTING IT DONE believe your story. If your story contains even a single piece of verifiable evidence that is easily understood by the masses, the chance your audience will believe it is 1 higher. If it contains more than 4 distinct verifiable pieces of hard evidence, the chance your audience will believe it is 2 higher. These two bonuses stack with each other. LUCK can never be spent on a Believability Check. Impact is how much change any individual story or revelation you publish has on your audience. For example, a story about an unfair economic practice at the incremental level might just get a few local bosses to change their practices. But at higher levels of Credibility, your exposé may cause entire Megacorps to fall. Your GM will handle this. Once you publish a story/scoop you cannot publish another story on the same exact topic unless you have new information to add to the conversation. ▶ CReDibility RAnks 1 AnD 2 Access/Sources: Local honcho, gang lord, local neighborhood leadership Audience: Immediate neighborhood. Believability: 2 out of 10 chance the audience buys it. Impact: Change created by a story/scoop is small, incremental. Small-time bad guys are scared and may change their ways a little. ▶ CReDibility RAnks 3 AnD 4 Access/Sources: City gang honcho, minor politician, Corp Exec, well known person in the neighborhood Audience: You're well known as a contributor on the local screamsheet or Data Pool. Believability: 3 out of 10 chance the audience buys it. Impact: Change created by a story/scoop has a direct effect; local small-time bad guys get arrested or thrown out of power, justice gets served. ▶ CReDibility RAnks 5 AnD 6 Access/Sources: Major City player, City politico, local celebrity Audience: Your stuff goes Citywide. You're a regular columnist or contributor to local screamsheets or TV. Believability: 4 out of 10 chance the audience buys it. Impact: Change created by a story/scoop changes things all over the City. Higher-level bad guys may be jailed or thrown out of power. Local laws may even get passed. ▶ CReDibility RAnks 7 AnD 8 Access/Sources: Local Corp president, mayor or City manager, City celebrity Audience: Your stuff goes Statewide. You are a minor celeb in your own right. Believability: 5 out of 10 chance the audience buys it. Impact: Change created by a story/scoop can change things all over several cities. Mid-level corporations or governments may be thrown out of power. Laws may be passed that affect people over several cities. ▶ CReDibility RAnks 9 Access/Sources: Divisional Corp head, State politico, well known celebrity Audience: You are known by many across the country, but not by everyone. If they've seen you, chances are it is on a national newsfeed. 153 GETTING IT DONE Believability: 6 out of 10 chance the audience buys it. Impact: Change created by a story/scoop can change things all over a major area like a whole nation. Large corporations or local governments may be toppled. Laws may be passed that affect people over a national area. ▶ CReDibility RAnks 10 Access/Sources: Major world leader, major Corporation head, world-famous celebrity Audience: You are known worldwide. People stop you for autographs and people in high places use you to leak important stuff. Believability: 7 out of 10 chance the audience buys it. Impact: Change created by a story/scoop can change things all over the world. Megacorps and powerful governments may fall or be overthrown. International laws may be established. Change can affect millions. teAmwoRk (exeC Role Ability) Just like a real corporate executive, the Exec builds a team whose members help them accomplish their goals, whether legal or not, morale permitting. The Exec Role Ability is Teamwork. ▶ Signing Bonus ◀ At Teamwork Rank 1, as a gift, the Exec is given a suit comprised of a Businesswear Jacket, Top, Bottom, and Footwear that identify them as a member of the business elite. The Exec cannot resell these without raising suspicion. ▶ Corporate Housing ◀ At Teamwork Rank 2, the Exec is given access to one of their Company's Corporate Conapts. As long as they remain a member of that Corporation, they can stay there without paying any Rent or any other fees. The Exec must still buy their own Lifestyle separately every month. If the Exec leaves to join another Corporation, they will extend to them the same offer, and even pay to move all their stuff to the new apartment. At Teamwork Rank 7, the Exec's corporate housing is improved to a Beaverville House in the Executive Zone. At Teamwork Rank 10, the Exec's corporate housing is improved dramatically to a Beaverville McMansion in the Executive Zone or a Luxury Penthouse in the Corporate Zone. ▶ Corporate Health Insurance ◀ At Teamwork Rank 6, the Exec is given Trauma Team Silver coverage, paid for monthly by their Corporation. If the Exec leaves to join another Corporation, they will extend to them the same offer. At Teamwork Rank 8, the Corporation upgrades their coverage to Trauma Team Executive. whaT if i GeT fired? G e t t in g f ir e d su c k s , but even as a starting Character, you aren't just anybody. An Exec or Lawman with skills is always in demand. Get yourself out there, and you'll have another gig in less than a week. In times like these, the labor market has been flipped on its head. Not many people can do the job of an Exec and anyone willing to be a Lawman is in high demand. Learn from the experience and get in good with your new boss so that you won't have to do this again for a while. Your Agent is bound to start blowing up with calls from headhunting Fixers by lunch. Nothing about your Role Ability changes when you get fired. Think of it as an opportunity for Character development as you and your GM work together to figure out just who wants to hire you and what the \"on boarding\" process is like. As for your now former employer? Consider that an opportunity, too. Just how much revenge do you want, choomba? And what happens if you blab some of their secrets? 154 GETTING IT DONE ▶ Team Members ◀ Starting at Rank 3, Teamwork give the Exec a Team Member. Ranks 5 and 9 of Teamwork give the Exec an additional Team Member, capping out at a maximum of 3 total Team Members at Rank 9. Team Members are rolled from a special chart for each of their jobs. The Exec chooses which class of Team Members they want, but their roll on the chart determines the STATs of the Team Member HR hires for them. While constructed like Player Characters, they vary in several distinct ways. • They do not improve their Skills. They determine and heal their HP like Player Characters do. • They are controlled by the GM, and their ability to follow an order depends on their Loyalty and ability to make a Loyalty Check. • They cannot wear Armor other than Light Armorjack. Company Policy. Losing Team Members: If a Team Member is lost, HR will repossess their equipment and replace them during the next game session. This \"new hire\" has new STATs, but their starting Loyalty is reduced to 1 (they heard about what happened). In addition, this will cost the Exec an additional 200eb in \"hiring fees\" (bribes) to HR. What, you thought HR just hired assassins for you? Loyalty: While Team Members work for the Exec, they are not mindless drones. They do the tasks given to them by the Exec based on their Loyalty to their boss (or the paycheck they sign for them). Loyalty is a shifting value; an Exec must (during every game session) do things to promote Loyalty and not lose it. Loyalty caps at maximum of 10 between game sessions, but during an individual game session, Loyalty has no limit. Loyalty Save: When a task is given to a Team Member by the Exec, the GM must roll 1d6 under the Team member's current Loyalty. If the Save is failed, the Team Member may refuse or botch the assignment or otherwise turn on the Exec. If Loyalty drops to 0 or lower, the Team Member will actively attempt to betray the Exec to their enemies. If at the end of a session a Team Member has less than 0 Loyalty, they will complain to HR and either receive a transfer or quit upon having one refused, depending on HR's whims. Either way, they are gone. See Losing Team Members, just above. Gaining Loyalty Gain Compliment Team Member's work. Overuse this during a week and it will stop gaining you Loyalty with the Team Member. +1 Give them a bonus or other perk of at least 200eb in value. +4 Support them against Management. +4 Give them a 20% cut of your earnings for a job. +6 Give Team Member paid time off. Must be for an entire game session. +6 Risk physical harm for Team Member. +8 Losing Loyalty Loss Gain no Loyalty with Team Member during an entire game session. -1 Berate or chew out Team Member or their work. -2 Ignore Team Member's contribution to a job. Forget Team Member's Birthday. -4 Do not come through with bonus or perk promised. -6 Throw them under the bus to Management. -6 Abandon Team Member under fire. -8 Tor more on Housing see page 377. For more on Trauma Team Insurance see page 223. 155 GETTING IT DONE ▶ Creating Your Team Members ◀ Job: Decide what your Team Member's job is. If you want to, you can also pick a cover job for them as well. You might not want other people to know you've got a Covert Ops specialist or Netrunner on the payroll. STATs: Roll 1d6 and read across the corresponding row, recording each STAT. Don't forget to determine their HP, Mortally Wounded, and Death Save values. You do not need to lower their EMP due to Humanity Loss from cyberware. That's already been factored in. Skills, Cyberware, and Gear: Record your Team Member's Skills, Cyberware, and Gear. These are stan- dard packages provided to them by the company. Starting Loyalty: Roll 1d6 and add 1. This is your Team Member's starting Loyalty. ▶ ComPAny boDyGuARD Cover Jobs: Escort, Personal Trainer•True Job: To protect the Exec in dangerous situations.

Lawmen can call upon the help of a group of fellow law enforcers, based on the Lawman's Backup Rank and the conditions under which the call is made. The Backup will be armed and armored based on the table below, and will be played by the GM. As a Lawman increases in Rank, they are likely to be promoted within their current law enforcement organization or to be recruited by law enforcement agencies that they can currently call Backup from. When in danger, you can call on Backup from a group of your Backup Rank or lower. As an Action, you attempt to roll equal or lower than your Backup Rank on a d10 to get someone to respond to your call. If you abuse this, your Boss will throw you off the force or fine you as they see fit. After someone responds to your call, you roll a d6 to find out in how many Rounds your backup will arrive on the scene. If you roll a 6 on this roll, instead of your typical backup, the backup that arrives will be of the next highest level of backup, unless you are Rank 10, in which case two separate backup groups will arrive. If nobody responds to your call, you can always try your backup call again next Turn. ▶ Backup Ranks ◀ Combat Number: A Skill Base used for both offense and defense. This number com- bines both STAT and Skill for them. You will add a d10 roll to this value whenever attacking with their carried weapons or equipment or defending. Backup cannot dodge bullets. SP: The stopping power of the armor on both their Body and Head location. HP: The amount of Hit Points that each member of the backup has. MOVE & BODY: The backup's MOVE and BODY STAT, important for movement and for some effects that reference the target's MOVE or BODY (like Death Saves). ▶ bACkuP RAnk 1 AnD 2 Combat Number: 8•SP: 7•HP: 20•MOVE & BODY: 4 Corporate Security.

He gets pinned down by a boostergang and calls for backup using his Action, rolling a 4 on the d10, which is a success because it is a result of his rank or lower! He rolls 1d6 to see how many Rounds it will take for backup to arrive and rolls a 6! Not only does this mean that, in 6 Rounds, backup will arrive, but also that instead of 4 Local Beat Cops responding, backup from 1 Backup tier higher, 2 heavy-firepower-wielding Count y Mounties will arrive.

Like the marshals of the Old West, these are lone Lawmen who patrol the Recovery Zones and new cities. One arrives on a Superbike, carrying a Very Heavy Pistol, Assault Rifle, Grenade Launcher, and wearing Flak Armor. ▶ bACkuP RAnk 9 Combat Number: 15•SP: 18•HP: 35•MOVE & BODY: 4 C-SWAT. Two heavy hitters from the Psycho Squad. They carry assault rifles and rocket launchers, wearing Metalgear®. Will arrive from the air in an AV-4. ▶ bACkuP RAnk 10 Combat Number: 14•SP: 11•HP: 35•MOVE & BODY: 6 National Law Enforcement/Interpol/FBI/Netwatch. These are serious hitters, operating under the control of national governments or international law enforcement groups. They travel in pairs, will arrive in an AV-4, and are outfitted with Very Heavy Pistols, Assault Rifles, in Light Armorjack. Unlike all other forms of Backup, these serious hitters stick around after the conflict ends and assist in investi- gating the scene. While they will not travel with the Crew on a day-to-day basis, after the first time they are called the same 2 serious hitters will always respond to calls for backup connected to the initial call until the \"case\" is closed, or they fall in the line of duty. Additionally, they can use their Combat Number for these Skills: Accounting, Acting, Conceal/Reveal Object, Criminology, Cryptography, Deduction, Education, Forgery, Interrogation, Paramedic, Perception, Personal Grooming, Resist Torture/Drugs, Stealth, and Tracking. oPeRAtoR (FixeR Role Ability) The Fixer's Role Ability is Operator. Fixers know how to get things on the black market and are adept at navi- gating the complex social customs of The Street, where hundreds of cultures and economic levels collide. Fixers maintain vast webs of contacts and clients. Contacts represents who the Fixer can reach out in order to source goods, favors, or information. The Fixer will still have to pay for these, of course. Reach is the highest price category of items that a Fixer can always source, and if they can use their influence to gather other Fixers into creating a Night Market, which makes all price categories of items available to them for a short time. (See pg. 338 for rules on setting up Night Markets) Haggle is the ability of the Fixer to strike a deal. When haggling with a person, you roll COOL + Trading Skill + Your Operator Rank + 1d10 against their COOL + Trading Skill + Their Operator Rank (if they are a Fixer) + 1d10. If you succeed, you can make 1 deal of your Operator Rank or lower. Only 1 Fixer deal can be made per transaction. Grease represents the Fixer's ability to blend into the many cultures on and off The Street; ability to know the language, social codes, and status marks for each group or culture. There's a tangled web of treaties between public and private law enforcement groups in Night City. That means they'll often help one another out and then send the bill for it to the appropriate department later.BY ADRIAN MARC 160 GETTING IT DONE ▶ Operator Ranks ◀ ▶ oPeRAtoR RAnks 1 AnD 2 Contacts & Clients: Local honcho, gang lord, local neighborhood leadership Reach: You can always find a place to source Cheap and Everyday items for your clients on a piece-by- piece basis, even if they are otherwise unavailable.

The Nomad Role Ability is Moto. ▶ Nomad Vehicle Familiarity ◀ Being part of a Nomad Family means spending your life in the driver's seat and under the hood, improving your driving abilities and vehicle knowledge enough to get by on familiarity alone or with training to pull off impressive feats with ease. A Nomad adds their Moto Rank to any Drive Land Vehicle, Pilot Air Vehicle, Pilot Sea Vehicle, Air Vehicle Tech, Land Vehicle Tech, or Sea Vehicle Tech Skill Check they make. ▶ Family Motorpool ◀ Whenever a Nomad increases their Role Ability Rank, they have the option of: • Either adding a stock vehicle (with minimum specs) of their Moto Rank or lower to the pool of vehicles they have permission to use from the Family Motorpool. • Or upgrading one of the Nomad's already permitted Family Vehicles with a single upgrade of their Moto Rank or lower. 162 GETTING IT DONE A Nomad can only have one of their Family Vehicles out at a time. A Nomad can call one of their Family to get their current Family Vehicle swapped out with another of their loaned Family Vehicles, and, assuming their Family is close by, the vehicle can be swapped out the following morning. If destroyed, the Family will fully repair any Family Vehicle for the Nomad, but it will take a week's time. The Nomad will also be expected to pay 500eb for the service. Even Family Heads pay this because it's a way of saving face for damaging Family property. It might be waived if you are broke, but your reputation would suffer. Daily repairs like bullet removal are the Nomad's responsibility. Upon attaining the 10th Rank in their Role Ability, a Nomad is promoted to a leadership position in their Family, with all the responsibility that entails. While leading by example, such a Nomad can have all their Family Vehicles out at a time. Any future Family Vehicles they wish to purchase are bought at market price, and any future upgrades they desire can be bought at 1,000eb a piece. ▶ FAmily motoRPool Rank Family Vehicle 1 to 4 Compact Groundcar, Gyrocopter, Jetski, Roadbike 5 to 6 Helicopter, High Performance Groundcar, Speedboat 7 to 8 AV-4, Cabin Cruiser, Superbike 9 to 10 Aerozep, AV-9, Super Groundcar, Yacht, More information on vehicles can be found on page 189BY NEIL BRANQUINHO 163 GETTING IT DONE ▶ Nomad Vehicle Upgrades ◀ Unless stated otherwise, an option can only be taken once per vehicle. These upgrades are also rarely sold on the open market, at Very Expensive for those attainable at Moto Rank 1, and at Luxury for those not attainable at Rank 1. ▶ All vehiCles Rank Required Upgrade 5 Armored Chassis: Armors the vehicle at SP13. Doesn't affect the vehicle's glass. 1 Bulletproof Glass: Instead of providing no protection, all glass on the vehicle is now considered to be cover: Thin Bulletproof Glass (15 HP). If upgraded a second time, it becomes Thick Bulletproof Glass (30 HP). All windows on the vehicle sustain damage individually. 1 Communications Center: Easily accessible touchscreen console with onboard Agent and storage space loaded with removable tech: 6 Radio Communicators, 6 Scrambler/Descramblers, a Radio Scanner/Music Player, a Homing Tracer with 6 button-sized linked tracers, and an Audio Recorder. 1 NOS: A burst of power when you need it. Allows you to use your Action to use an additional Move Action when driving a vehicle. Each tank of NOS can be used once per day. Each additional upgrade adds an additional tank. The tanks capture nitrogen and oxygen from the air and synthesize nitrous oxide on their own, never needing refilling. 1 Onboard Flamethrower: A Flamethrower you can mount front, side, or back-facing on the exterior of a vehicle. The driver can fire it using their Action. Cannot be reloaded while driving. Weapon cannot be removed and cannot accept weapon attachments. Multiple upgrades can be installed. 1 Onboard Machine gun: An Assault Rifle with 30 rounds only capable of using Autofire that you can mount front facing on the exterior of a vehicle. The driver can fire it using their Action. Cannot be reloaded while driving. Weapon cannot be removed and cannot accept weapon attachments. Multiple upgrades can be installed. 1 Seating Upgrade: Adds two seats to the vehicle. If desired, these extra seats can come in a sidecar, which can be fully enclosed with the same glass as the rest of the vehicle, with side windows optional. Additionally, any seats in a vehicle with this upgrade can be rigged as ejector seats, firing the contents of the seat 10 m/yds into the air above the vehicle, through a trapdoor mechanism in the ceiling of the vehicle, if needed. An ejected passenger struck by a helicopter blade during such an ejection takes damage as if they had been struck by a Very Heavy Melee Weapon. Typically, these ejection seats are rigged with parachutes, but these could always be removed. This upgrade can be taken multiple times for all vehicles except Bikes, Jetskis, and Gyrocopters. 5 Security Upgrade: Replaces all the locks on the vehicle with DNA locks, which can be set up to accept a thumbprint, iris scan, blood sample, or any other desired biometric method. Such a lock cannot be unlocked without either its biometric key or a DV 17 Electronics/Security Tech Check. A person who presents an inaccurate biometric key, or fails a Check to open one of the locks without the correct biometric key is struck as if they had been hit in the body by a Stun Baton if they are within two m/yds of the vehicle. Additionally, the Security Upgrade adds a cloaking feature to the vehicle, allowing it to hide itself from all but a DV17 Perception Check, assuming it remains still. System takes a minute to engage, and operates by taking a video of the vehicle's surroundings and projecting it on the surface of the vehicle in real time, aided in part by nanomachines which cover hard-to-reach areas. 1 Smuggling Upgrade: Upgrades the vehicle with two onboard Hidden Holsters (exactly the same rules-wise as the Cyberware of the same name) which provide the driver and one passenger with an easily accessible concealed weapon, and one large space hidden somewhere within the vehicle for smuggling purposes. These spaces can only be discovered with a DV17 Conceal/Reveal Object Check. This upgrade can be taken multiple times with all vehicles except: Bikes, Jetskis, and Gyrocopters. 164 GETTING IT DONE ▶ All vehiCles exCePt bikes, Jetskis, GyRoCoPteRs Rank Required Upgrade 1 Heavy Chassis: Adds 20 SDP to the vehicle. This doesn't affect the vehicle's glass. A vehicle with this upgrade can tow up to 10 tons. It might even have a large tow cable, appearance-wise. This upgrade is a prerequisite for some of the heavier duty vehicle upgrades. 5 Onboard Rocket Pod: A Rocket Launcher with a drum of three rockets that you can mount front facing on the exterior of a vehicle. The driver can fire it using their Action. Cannot be reloaded while driving. Weapon cannot be removed and cannot accept weapon attachments. Multiple upgrades can be installed, but what job requires more than three rockets...? Requires Heavy Chassis. 5 Vehicle Heavy Weapon Mount: Upgrade transforms one of the vehicle's seats into a swiveling mount for any two-handed ranged weapon, which can be fired by a passenger using their Action. The passenger also can reload this mounted weapon while the vehicle is in motion. This weapon can be removed or reinstalled using an Action. The first time a Nomad upgrades one of their vehicles with one of these, their Family will include with it a Tsunami Arms Helix, Rhinemetall EMG-86 Railgun, or Militech \"Cowboy\" U-56 Grenade Launcher as a gift, but all others are up to the Nomad to source. If the vehicle has Bulletproof Glass, a bubble of the same glass protects the gunner. Multiple upgrades can only be installed on Cabin Cruisers, Yachts, Aerozeps, and Groundcars that already have the Housing Capacity Upgrade installed. Requires Heavy Chassis. ▶ All lAnD AnD seA vehiCles Rank Required Upgrade 1 Onboard Melee Weapon: A Very Heavy Melee Weapon you can mount front, side, or back facing on the exterior of a vehicle. The driver can attack with it using their Action. Weapon cannot be removed. Multiple upgrades can be installed. ▶ All lAnD vehiCles Rank Required Upgrade 5 Hover Upgrade: This upgrade installs a series of powerful fans onto the base of the vehicle that allow it to travel across the surface of the water at the speed of a Cabin Cruiser. 7 AV-4 Engine Upgrade: This upgrade adds a vectored thrust turbofan engine to the vehicle, allowing flight! As far as movement is concerned, treat the vehicle as an AV-4 while it is in the air. The vehicle is piloted using the Pilot Air Vehicle Skill instead of the Drive Land Vehicle Skill when it is in the air. ▶ All lAnD AnD seA vehiCles exCePt bikes AnD Jetskies Rank Required Upgrade 1 Combat Plow: Whenever you slam the front of the vehicle into a piece of cover, another vehicle, or an unlucky pedestrian your vehicle doesn't take any damage and nobody in your vehicle suffers the Whiplash Critical Injury. If your vehicle was boosted by NOS on the Turn when you slammed the front of your vehicle into a piece of cover, other vehicle, or unlucky pedestrian, damage dealt by your vehicle's ramming increases by 2d6. 165 GETTING IT DONE ▶ All bikes Rank Required Upgrade 5 Enhanced Interface Plug Integration: When you use your Interface Plugs to drive your bike with this upgrade, if you can dodge bullets (REF 8 or higher), and you, a passenger on your bike, or your bike are targeted by an attack that you could dodge or otherwise avoid on foot, you can attempt to dodge or avoid that attack with your Evasion Skill, just like you would if you were on foot. Your choice to dodge \"becomes\" the chosen defense of your passenger automatically. In the case of an explosive or other area attack, your bike swerves out of its range if you successfully dodge, just as such an effect would cause you to do if you were on foot. ▶ All GRounDCARDs Rank Required Upgrade 1 Deployable Spike Strip: Can be deployed by the driver as an Action. When deployed, any closely trailing vehicles with tires must make a DV17 Drive Land Vehicle Check. Should they fail the Check, their vehicle takes 4d6 damage to its weak point (damage that gets through any vehicle's SP is multiplied by 2). Replacement spike strips are 10eb (Cheap). Multiple upgrades increase the amount of spike strips that can be deployed before the mechanism needs to be reloaded, which can't happen while the vehicle is moving. ▶ AeRoZeP, Av-4, CAbin CRuiseR, GRounDCARs, yACht Rank Required Upgrade 1 Housing Capacity: When installed in a Groundcar or AV-4, this upgrade adds a sleeping area with 1 bed, a toilet, a shower, and a small kitchen to the vehicle, turning it into a Kombi. When installed in a Cabin Cruiser, Yacht, or Aerozep, the upgrade instead adds one room to the vehicle. Requires a Heavy Chassis on Compact Groundcar and High Performance Groundcar. .BY ADRIAN MARC 10:19 AM Books since you enjoyed I Was There by C.J. O'Reilly...

In roleplaying, the \"board\" is your imagination; the environment is described to you by the GM and it's up to you to imagine in your mind's eye where everything is, based on those descriptions (although grid maps and miniatures are sometimes used as visual aids in more complex situations). 168 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT I n Combat Time We've already discussed how time flows in a Cyberpunk RED game on pg. 126. Now, let's talk about when things get violent or very specific. This is when you absolutely need to know who's faster and a Skill Check (covered in-depth on pg. 128) isn't gonna cut it... you are definitely in combat. Roll Initiative! initiAtive AnD CombAt time To recap, combat is divided into Turns, each of which takes approximately 3 seconds. The amount of time it takes each entity involved in the combat to take a Turn is a Round. Because Actions happen roughly simultaneously in game, one Round is also approximately 3 seconds long. When a combat starts, everyone rolls Initiative: Initiative = REF + 1d10 All participants in the combat place themselves according to their Initiative Roll into what we call an Initiative Queue in descending order. Resolve ties by rolling again until the higher number wins. Combat proceeds in Initiative Queue order, with each entity in the Initiative Queue getting a Turn. When the bottom is reached, the Initiative Queue starts again from the top in a new Round. Your Turn = 1 Move Action + 1 other Action Every Turn, a Character gets 1 Move Action and 1 Action A ctions Actions are the meat of your Turn in Cyberpunk RED. Here are the basic uses for your Action in combat. Combat-focused Actions are explained in greater detail later in this section. ▶ CombAt ACtions in bRieF Action Data Move Action Move up to as many m/yds as your MOVE STAT x 2 each Turn (or squares equal to your MOVE STAT). Attack Make a Melee or Ranged Attack. Choke Choke an opponent you have Grabbed. Equip/Drop Shield Equipping and dropping a Shield takes an Action. See Using Shields later in this section on pg. 183. Get into a Vehicle Get into a Vehicle. See Vehicle Combat later in this section on pg. 189. Get Up Get up after being Prone. While Prone, until you use this Action, you cannot use a Move Action. Grab Grab and hold an opponent or take away an object they are holding. 169 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT Action Data Hold Action Hold an Action until later in the Initiative Queue. You must choose a specified event to trigger the Action or a specific number in the Initiative Queue when the action occurs as well as what the Action is, and what its intended target is. Human Shield Equip an opponent you have Grabbed as a Human Shield. Reload Fully reload and replace a weapon's magazine with a single ammunition type. Run Take an additional Move Action, but only if you have already taken a Move Action this Turn. Start a Vehicle Start a Vehicle to gain its MOVE and jump to the top of the Initiative Queue. Stabilize Stabilize a target to begin the natural healing process or pull them out of the Mortally Wounded Wound State to save their life. See on pg. 222. Throw Throw a grabbed opponent to the ground or throw an object. Use NET Actions Perform multiple NET Actions inside the NET. See Netrunning Section for how to use NET Actions on pg. 197. Use an Object Manipulate an object in a way that doesn't require a Skill. Drawing an easily accessible weapon into a free hand or dropping a held weapon (not a shield) onto the floor does not require this Action but stowing a held weapon on your person does. Use a Skill Use one of your Skills to accomplish a quick task. A longer task will require multiple Actions over the course of multiple Turns, rolling only when the full time has been paid for in 3-second increments. Vehicle Maneuver Use your Action while driving to focus entirely on making a dangerous Maneuver. A ctions in Detail Here are some specifics you may want to know about certain Actions. move ACtion Every Turn, a Character gets a Move Action, which can only be used to move a number of m/yds equal to their MOVE x 2, or a number of squares (if playing on a grid) equal to their MOVE, which can include moving diagonally. If you are playing on a grid, you cannot stop in between the squares. ▶ Prone ◀ When you are Prone, you can't use your Move Action until you use the Get Up Action. ▶ Split Movement and ROF ◀ Combat in Cyberpunk RED is fast-paced and fluid. Whenever you Move using your Move Action, you can take your Action in the middle of that Move Action, and then keep Moving afterwards. We call this Splitting, and it's not just for Move Actions. Some types of attacks are faster than others, capable of striking/ shooting twice with a single Attack Action. These are called 2 Rate of Fire Attacks (or 2 ROF). All attacks from 2 ROF sources can be \"split\" across a Move Action. You can move, shoot, move, shoot, move. You can even make a single attack from each of two different 2 ROF sources by \"Splitting\" your two attacks across the two of them, allowing them both to be used in a single Turn. So yes, you can use the Heavy Pistol in your left hand to take a shot down the hallway, then walk down that disgusting hallway to stab your victim with the machete in your right hand. Attacks from 1 ROF sources are slower, and take your whole Attack Action, but you can still split move- ment around them. ▶ Other Forms of Movement ◀ Swimming, Climbing, and Jumping with a running start all cost 2 m/yds of movement for every m/yd traveled or 2 squares for every 1 square. When jumping from standing you can clear half the dis- tance that you could with a running start. See Taking Damage later in this section (pg. 180) for more on falling and drowning. No matter how many weapons you're holding, you can never make more than two Attack Checks as part of an Action. You also can't attack with two 1 ROF weapons in the same Action, even if you're dual wielding them. 170 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT AimeD shots At a maximum of 1 ROF you can aim a single Ranged or Melee Attack by taking your entire Action and a -8 to your Check to aim for any of these special areas. If you hit, you deal the attack's damage as normal, and you also get an additional effect based on the special area you aimed for. Aiming for... Effect Head Multiply the damage that gets through your target's head armor by 2. Held Item If a single point of damage gets through your target's body armor, your target drops one item of your choice held in their hands. It lands on the ground in front of them. Leg If a single point of damage gets through your target's body armor, your target also suffers the Broken Leg Critical Injury if they have any legs left that aren't broken. DRAwinG, DRoPPinG, AnD stowinG Drawing an easily accessible weapon into a free hand isn't an Action. Dropping a held weapon to the ground isn't an Action but stowing it on your person is an Action. One exception: equipping and dropping a Shield takes an Action. See Using a Shield later in this section on pg. 183. ReloAD Sometimes, you empty the clip. You can use an Action to fully reload and replace a magazine with a single ammunition type. You can't mix ammunition types in a magazine. R anged Combat Ranged combat includes any attack made at a distance. Let's look at what is on offer in the Dark Future. how to ReAD the RAnGeD weAPon tAble Weapon Type: The classification of the weapon. Weapon Skill: The Skill you use when firing this weapon.

He rolls weapon damage (5d6) and gets 25, blasting the booster straight into Mortally Wounded.

Instead of directly modeling individual bullets, we've moved to modeling patterns of bullets. Being skilled at keeping an automatic gun on target allows you to bring out the best in Autofire. When you use Autofire, it costs an Action and 10 bullets. If you don't have 10 bullets remaining in your clip, you can't use Autofire. You use the Autofire Skill instead of the weapon's typical Weapon Skill. Additionally, instead of the weapon's entry on the Range Table, you use its entry on the Autofire Range Table. Autofire cannot be used to make an Aimed Shot. Targets with REF 8 or Higher can still choose to attempt to dodge your Autofire. If you hit, roll 2d6 for damage, and multiply it by the amount you beat the DV to hit your target, up to a maximum denoted by the weapon's Autofire (3 for SMGS, 4 for Assault Rifles). This number is the amount of damage that Autofire dealt. If both dice came up 6, you've also inflicted a Critical Injury (see pg. 187)! The Defender's armor reduces the damage you do, as detailed later in this section on pg. 186. ▶ AutoFiRe Dvs bAseD on RAnGe Weapon Type 0 to 6 m/yds 7 to 12 m/yds 13 to 25 m/yds 26 to 50 m/yds 51 to 100 m/yds SMGs 20 17 20 25 30 Assault Rifle 22 20 17 20 25 auTofire examPLe Royal is backed into a corner by a particularly large nude boosterganger seeking revenge for what happened last week (see pg. 170). Royal fires his assault rifle in glorious Autofire Mode. According to the Autofire specific Range Table, he needs to beat a DV17 to hit a target 14 m/yds away. Royal rolls 1d10, gets a 7, and adds his 8 REF + 6 Autofire Skill, for a total of 21. Since he beat the Autofire DV17 by 4, he rolls 2d6 for damage, getting 10, and multiplies the result by 4, the amount he beat the Autofire DV by, for a total of 40 damage. Ouch! Hope this one has Skinweave! 174 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT ▶ Arrows ◀ Bows and Crossbows fire Arrows. Because loading an Arrow is part of attacking with a Bow or Crossbow, you never need to Reload a Bow or Crossbow using the Reload Action. Additionally, Basic Arrows can always be retrieved after they are fired, making buying basic ammunition for these weapons almost a one-time investment. ▶ Suppressive Fire ◀ When you use Suppressive Fire, it costs an Action and 10 Bullets. If you don't have 10 Bullets remain- ing in your clip, you can't use Suppressive Fire. Everyone on foot within 25 m/yds, out of cover, and in your line of sight must roll WILL + Concentration + 1d10 against your REF + Autofire Skill + 1d10. Anyone that fails must use their next Move Action to get into cover. If that Move Action would be insufficient to get into cover, they must also use the Run Action to get into cover or as close to cover as possible. ▶ Shotgun Shells ◀ In addition to Slugs, Shotguns can also fire Shotgun Shells. You can't make an Aimed Shot with a Shotgun Shell. When you fire a Shotgun Shell, you make 1 Ranged Attack (REF + Shoulder Arms + 1d10) vs. a DV13. If successful every target in front of you, within 6m/yds (3 squares), that you can see, takes 3d6 damage if you hit. You roll damage once for all targets. The Defender's armor will reduce the damage you do, as detailed later in this section on pg. 186. Individual targets with REF 8 or Higher can still choose to attempt to dodge your Shotgun Shell. ▶ Explosives ◀ All explosives weapons deal their damage to all targets (including the terrain) in a 10m/yd by 10m/yd area (5 Square by 5 Square), the center of which is your intended target (which is a 2m/ yd by 2m/yd square, not an individual). You only roll damage once for all targets. If you roll under the DV required to hit your intended target, the GM decides where in that 10m/yard by 10m/yard square centered on your intended target the explosive actually landed, and it instead damages a 10m/yard by 10m/yard square around that point. Anyone with REF 8 or higher can choose to indi- vidually dodge the blast by rolling higher than your original Check, placing themselves outside of the blast area if they succeed. An explosive blast will not damage a target behind cover that its damage would be insufficient to destroy. However, if the damage from the explosive would be sufficient to destroy the cover, the individual is no longer behind cover and they take full damage.

There's never one around when you really need it. You figure the kids down the hall stole it, or you dropped it behind the dumpster (where you stashed that body) again. Looks like you're going to have to fall back on Melee Combat. Melee combat is using weapons that you swing or stab. It also applies to anytime you use the parts of your body (like feet, hands, head, etc.) to strike an opponent. how to ReAD the melee weAPon tAble Melee Weapon Type: The classification of the melee weapon. Example Melee Weapons: A few examples of the classification of melee weapons. Number of Hands Required: How many hands you need to hold the weapon and use it. In the case of melee weapons the number of hands required is based on what the weapon is and not its classification. Damage: The damage of a single attack from the weapon. Rate of Fire (ROF): How many times the weapon can be swung with a single Attack Action. Can be Concealed?: If the weapon can be concealed with the Conceal/Reveal Object Skill under clothing. Cost: What the weapon costs in the main currency in Night City, the Eurobuck. The Price Category of the item is listed below its cost. See Buying and Selling on Page 385.

The Combat Zone is a tough place to play as a solo act. The assailants set upon Rico Rico with machetes (medium melee weapons). They attack Rico Rico with their DEX + Melee Weapon Skill + 1d10, vs. Rico Rico's DEX + Evasion Skill + 1d10. Medium Melee Weapons have a ROF 2, meaning 2 poten- tial hits per Attack Action, so with two assailants, Rico Rico has to dodge the clowns' machetes four times before he gets a Turn. He dodges three attacks, but the fourth hits him and rolls a 7 for damage. Damage dealt by Melee Weapons ignores half of the defend- er's armor (round up), so Rico Rico's SP11 Light Armorjack is treated as SP6, meaning 1 damage slips through. Rico Rico's Light Armorjack is also Ablated, which decreases it's SP by one to 10. 176 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT melee weAPons in CombAt Trained use of a melee weapon includes fencing, knife fighting, and club or other bludgeoning weapons, even staves and baseball bats. Melee weapons use the Melee Weapon Skill to attack. When dealing damage, all melee weapons ignore half of the Defender's armor. Round up. Damage is dealt based on the Classification of the melee weapon. Heavier weapons deal more damage but can't be concealed under clothing with the Conceal/Reveal Object Skill. Very Heavy Melee Weapons can't attack twice in an Attack Action. Melee weapons must be wielded in the number of hands that they were designed for, unless their handedness is specifically stated as otherwise, with one exception: A Character with BODY 8 or higher can wield a Melee Weapon designed to be wielded in two hands in a single hand. ResolvinG melee CombAt Melee Combat is resolved: Attacker's DEX + Relevant Melee Attack Skill + 1d10 vs. Defender's DEX + Evasion Skill + 1d10 With the exception of Very Heavy Melee Weapons, all Melee combat is 2 ROF, allowing for 2 strikes to be made with every Attack Action. Targets must be in your reach (2m/yards). If you beat the Defender's roll (Defender wins in a tie), you damage the Defender. The Defender's armor will reduce the damage you do, as detailed later on pg. 186. bRAwlinG, bARe knuCkle boxinG, AnD GRAPPlinG Brawling uses the Brawling Skill to attack, and the damage dealt with each blow scales with the attacker's BODY STAT, with one exception: with a Cyberarm, your damage for a Brawling Attack is always at least 2d6 (but higher if your BODY is 7+). Brawling is also the Skill used for initiating and defending against a Grapple. When dealing damage, a Brawling attack does not ignore half the Defender's armor. BODY 4 or Under 5 to 6 (or ≤ 4 w/ Cyberarm) 7 to 10 11 or Higher Damage 1d6 2d6 3d6 4d6 177 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT ▶ Grab ◀ As an Action you can grab and hold someone, take an object they are carrying, or escape a grapple. You need a free hand to initiate a Grab, which cannot be used to do anything else for the duration of any Grapple that results from the Grab. To determine the outcome of a Grab, both you and your target within your reach roll DEX + Brawling Skill + 1d10. If you win, you can choose to either grab hold of the Defender or take one object the Defender is holding in their hands into a free hand. If you win and choose to grab hold of the Defender instead of their stuff, both of you are now considered to be in a Grapple and take a -2 to all Actions for as long as you both remain in a Grapple. While Grappled, the Defender cannot use their Move Action, and is dragged with the Attacker whenever the Attacker takes their Move Action. No Character in the Grapple can make use of a weapon that requires them to use two hands, even if they have more than two arms. The Attacker can end the Grapple at any time without using an Action, but the Defender, or any other Character, must use this Action to roll a successful Grab against the Attacker to break the Grapple, which ends the Grapple for everyone involved. Grabbing a person is a prerequisite for Choking or Throwing them. ▶ Choke ◀ If you are currently the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to Choke the Defender you are grap- pling, dealing your BODY STAT directly to their Hit Points in damage. If damage dealt by a Choke would reduce a target with more than 1 HP to less than 0 HP, they are instead left at 1 HP and are Unconscious. This damage ignores the Defender's armor and doesn't ablate it. Additionally, if you Choke the same target for 3 successive Rounds, they go Unconscious regardless of their Hit Point total. ▶ Throw ◀ Throw a person you are Grappling or an object you are holding. If you are currently the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to Throw them onto the ground, dealing your BODY STAT directly to their Hit Points in damage. This damage ignores the Defender's armor and doesn't ablate it. Throwing your target ends your Grapple with them (freeing you both of the -2 to all Actions imposed by being either participant in a Grapple), and leaves them Prone, unable to use their Move Action until they use the Get Up Action. If you want to Throw an object, you can do so by using an Action to make a Ranged Attack using DEX + Athletics + 1d10, up to a maximum of 25m/yds, using the Grenade Launcher DV entry on the range table. If you are throwing the object at a person that can dodge bullets, they can choose to dodge your object as well. Melee weapons deal their stated damage when thrown, but don't halve SP. Grenades deal the same damage as they would when fired from a grenade launcher. An improvised thrown weapon does as much damage as the GM thinks it would.BY SANTIAGO BETANCUR 178 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT mARtiAl ARts Martial arts uses the Martial Arts Skill to make Martial Arts Attacks and perform Martial Arts Special Moves.

You can't use a Martial Arts Special Move without at least one point in that move's Form and many Martial Arts Special Moves also have individual requirements that must be met for use. Unless stated otherwise, Martial Arts Special Moves cannot be used to make Aimed Shots. Martial Arts Special Moves are resolved as described in the following section.BY NEIL BRANQUINHO 179 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT ▶ Shared Special Moves ◀ ▶ ReCoveRy No Requirement: All Martial Arts Forms may use this Move. Whenever you use the Get Up Action, you can attempt to beat a DV13 with the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution. If you succeed, that Get Up Action didn't cost an Action. ▶ Aikido ◀ This soft form practices sweeping hand and body techniques to lock and disarm opponents, turning their power against themselves. ▶ DisARminG CombinAtion Requirement: You hit the same target with a Brawling Attack and a Martial Arts Attack this Turn. Once per Turn when you fulfill this requirement, you can use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution to attempt to beat a DV15. If you succeed, any one object held in the hands of the target you hit twice this Turn is either held by you or is on the floor. ▶ iRon GRiP Requirement: You have a target successfully Grabbed that isn't already affected by Iron Grip. Once per Turn when you fulfill this requirement, as an Action you can use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution to attempt to beat a DV15. If you succeed, the target you are grappling makes all future attempts to escape this Grapple at an additional -2. Additionally, until the Grapple is broken, your target cannot make any Ranged Attacks. ▶ Karate ◀ This hard form practices strikes and blows designed to break an opponent's bones or armor. ▶ ARmoR bReAkinG CombinAtion Requirement: You hit the same target with a Melee Weapon and a Martial Arts Attack this Turn. Once per Turn when you fulfill this requirement, you can use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution to attempt to beat a DV15. If you succeed, the target you hit twice this Turn has all their worn armor ablated by an additional two points. ▶ bone bReAkinG stRike Requirement: WILL 8 or higher Instead of making 2 Attacks with your Martial Arts Attack Action you can choose to make a Bone Breaking Strike. Use your Action to use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution against a single target in Melee range. If you hit, your target suffers the Broken Ribs Critical Injury in addition to your Martial Arts Attack damage. If they already had this Critical Injury, they do not suffer another Critical Injury. If you take a -8 to your Check, you can instead use this Special Move to target your opponent's head location just like making an Aimed Shot, declaring you are doing so when you roll. If you hit, your target instead suffers the Cracked Skull Critical Injury, after damage is calculated. If they already had this Critical Injury, they do not suffer another Critical Injury. ▶ Judo ◀ This soft form practices grabs, throws, and escapes. ▶ CounteR thRow Requirement: You dodged all Melee Attacks that were targeted at you since your last Turn. Once per Turn when you fulfill this requirement, as an Action you may use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution to attempt to beat a DV15. If you succeed against the DV, you use the Throw Action on one target in melee range whose Melee Attack you dodged to satisfy this move's requirement. This throw cannot be avoided. If you beat your DV, they are getting thrown. You don't need to be grappling them. ▶ GRAb esCAPe Requirement: You hit a target that is grappling you with 2 Melee Attacks this Turn. Once per Turn when you fulfill this requirement, you can use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution to attempt to beat a DV15. If you succeed, you are no longer grappled by the target you hit twice, and they suffer the Broken Arm Critical Injury if they didn't have it already. You pick the arm. There's more info on Critical Injuries on page 187. 180 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT ▶ Taekwondo ◀ This hard form practices high kicks and precision strikes to break through defenses and cause severe injury through attacking pressure points. ▶ PRessuRe Point stRike Requirement: WILL 8 or higher. Instead of making 2 Attacks with your Martial Arts Attack Action you can choose to make a Pressure Point Strike. Use your Action to use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution against a single target in Melee range. If you hit, your target suffers the Spinal Injury Critical Injury in addition to your Martial Arts Attack damage. If they already had this Critical Injury, they do not suffer another Critical Injury. If you take a -8 to your Check, you can instead use this Special Move to target your opponent's head location just like making an Aimed Shot, declaring you are doing so when you roll. If you hit, your target instead suffers the Brain Injury Critical Injury. If they already had this Critical Injury, they do not suffer another Critical Injury ▶ FlyinG kiCk Requirement: MOVE 8 or higher. You must have moved at least 4m/yds already this Turn. Instead of making 2 Attacks with your Martial Arts Attack Action you can choose to make a Flying Kick. Use your Action and all your remaining movement this Turn to fling forward in a straight line toward your target that can be up to 4m/yards away from you. Use the Martial Arts Special Move Resolution against that target. If you hit, you deal damage to your target's body location as if you had struck them with a Martial Arts Attack. Additionally, if you hit, your target is now Prone and is removed from any motorcycle or other vehicle lacking a fully enclosed cabin that they may have been in or on. O ther Ways to get Hurt beSideS gunS and Sharp thingS beinG on FiRe When you are On Fire, until you use an Action to put yourself out, you take an amount of damage direct to your HP at the end of your Turn. Your armor isn't ablated. Remember that each Turn is only three seconds. This adds up. Intensity Example Effect Mild Wood Fire 2 Damage direct to HP Strong Gasoline Fire 4 Damage direct to HP Deadly Thermite 6 Damage direct to HP DRowninG AnD AsPhyxiAtion Characters can hold their breath for a number of minutes equal to their BODY. When you can't hold your breath any longer, you start Drowning. At the beginning of a Turn where you are Drowning, you take your BODY STAT directly to your Hit Points in damage. This damage ignores your armor and doesn't ablate it. Asphyxiation should be treated like Drowning, save that there are sometimes secondary effects. If you are Asphyxiating in space you will take an additional 1d6 in damage at the end of your Turn to your INT, REF, and DEX from exposure to the vacuum. If your INT reaches 0, you are dead. This damage to your STATs is reversed if you manage to get a breath of air. eleCtRoCution When you are electrocuted, you immedi- ately take 6d6 damage. This damage is soaked by armor as normal. If you don't move away from the source of your electrocution, this damage repeats at the end of each of your Turns, starting with your next Turn. you CAn't you CAn't shootshoot A Gun iF A Gun iF i've i've brokenbroken youR sPine. youR sPine. — petra \"leather belt\" davids— petra \"leather belt\" davids 181 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT exPosuRe Prolonged exposure to the extreme elements will deal 1d6 damage directly to your HP at the end of each day of exposure. While exposed to the extreme elements, even if Stabilized, you cannot heal naturally. With proper equipment for your environment, you will never risk exposure. FAllinG Falling Characters fall 40m/yds at the end of their Turn. At the moment they are no longer on solid ground, if an edge or ledge is nearby, they get one attempt to save themselves from flight with a DV15 Athletics Check. No Check is required if you have a Grapple Hand, Grapple Gun, etc. Upon hitting the ground, Characters who fall 10 m/yds or more take 2d6 damage for every 10 m/yds they fell (soaked by body armor) and unless they then succeed a DV15 Athletics Check, also suffer the Broken Leg Critical Injury. Characters with 2 Cyberlegs do not take this damage or suffer the Critical Injury. However, Cyberlegs do nothing to prevent damage or Critical Injury if the fall is greater than 30 m/yds. Common sense also dictates that if for some reason you fell off a skyscraper without a parachute, don't bother rolling a Death Save, you are dead. Poisons AnD DRuGs When you are Poisoned or Drugged, you must make a Resist Torture/Drugs Check against the DV of the attack. If you fail, you suffer the effect of the poison or drug. Your armor isn't ablated. Street drugs, their effects, and addiction are described at length in the Trauma Team Section on pg. 227. ▶ Poisons Intensity Examples Resist Torture/Drugs DV Effect Mild Belladonna, Toxic Waste 11 1d6 Damage direct to HP Strong Arsenic 13 2d6 Damage direct to HP Deadly Biotoxin, Designer Poison, Stonefish Venom 15 3d6 Damage direct to HP ▶ DRuGs Intensity Examples Resist Torture/Drugs DV Effect Mild Alcohol 11 Inebriation Strong Sodium Pentothal 13 Suggestibility Deadly Designer Drug 15 Designer's Intention RADiAtion Low level radiation exposure won't kill you immediately. Over time, it will make you sick, and then it will kill you, eventually, possibly through cancer. This is up to the GM to interpret. High level radiation is immediately dangerous. Every Turn that you remain in the hot zone, you are treated as being Mildly On Fire (see Being on Fire on pg. 180), except you cannot use an Action to put yourself out while you remain in the hot zone. If you are in an extremely hot zone, like being in a leaking reactor, you are treated as being Deadly On Fire instead. A lot of Corps used small nuclear reactors to power their facilities before the 4th Corp War, so there's a surprising number of hot zones out there. 182 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT B EFORE YOU TAKE THAT DAMAGE... You might want to check and see if there's any way to put something between you and all that badness that's about to pulp your body. Things like Taking Cover, Using Shields (or some unlucky booster who you got a good grip on) and Armor. tAkinG CoveR The Golden Rules of Cover You are considered to be in cover if you are fully behind something that could stop a bullet. If they have line of sight on you, you aren't in cover. There is no \"partial\" cover. It can either stop a bullet or it can't. If it cannot stop a bullet, it provides no cover and thus has no HP. Nothing is stopping your enemy from moving up to re-establish line of sight on you, rendering what was previously cover for you pointless, so make sure that your plan is better than their plan. The other method of getting somebody \"out of cover\" is removing the cover itself using something really fun, like a grenade. Anything you might want to take cover behind has HP, and a 2 m/yds by 2 m/yds (1 square) section of it can be attacked just like you can. At 0 HP, cover is destroyed. If a cover's HP drops to 0, excess damage is lost and doesn't harm any targets hiding behind it. You can hurt them with your next Attack. The one exception to this involves explosives (see page 174). CoveR hit Points Cover HP is determined by the material and its thickness. Thin cover might be able to be moved slightly in a pinch, but Thick cover is too unwieldy for Characters without BODY 10 or higher to move without special equipment. Steel cover cannot be damaged by Martial Arts or Brawling attacks except those made by Characters with a Cyberarm or BODY 10 or higher. Type of Cover Thick HP Thin HP Steel 50 HP 25 HP Stone 40 HP 20 HP Bulletproof Glass 30 HP 15 HP Concrete 25 HP 10 HP Wood 20 HP 5 HP Plaster/Foam/Plastic 15 HP 0 HP (Not Cover) coVer examPLe Someone takes a shot at Gina and misses. She's not sure where the sniper is, so she hunkers down behind a Thick Concrete barricade (25 HP) in the entrance to the nearby parking garage. The sniper's across the street, on the roof of an Oasis and they can no longer see Gina. Since the sniper has no line of sight on her, and Gina is too smart to leave the safety of cover while attempting to escape, they have two options: reposition or destroy the cover. They decide to keep shooting. On their Turn, the sniper shoots at the barricade. They make a Shoulder Arms Check vs. a DV deter- mined by their weapon (a sniper rifle) and the range and succeed. The shot does 17 damage, bringing the barricade's HP down to 8. One Round later, a second shot drops the barricade to 0 HP, blowing a nice big hole in it. The sniper can see Gina and, on their next Turn, can shoot at her directly. Unfortunately for the sniper, Gina's spent her last two Turns figuring out her attacker's position, she's a crack shot, she's pissed about being attacked, and she's got a higher Initiative. 183 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT ▶ CoveR mAteRiAl AnD thiCkness exAmPles Example Material and Thickness HP Bank Vault Door Thick Steel 50 HP Bank Window Glass Thick Bulletproof Glass 30 HP Bar Thick Wood 20 HP Boulder Thick Stone 40 HP Bulletproof Windshield Thin or Thick Bulletproof Glass 15 or 30 HP Car Door Thin Steel 25 HP Data Term Thick Concrete 25 HP Engine Block Thick Steel 50 HP Hydrant Thick Steel 50 HP Log Cabin Wall Thick Wood 20 HP Metal Door Thin Steel 20 HP Office Cubicle 0 HP (Not Cover) 0 HP Office Wall Thick Plaster/Foam/Plastic 15 HP Overturned Table Thin Wood 5 HP Prison Visitation Glass Thin Bulletproof Glass 15 HP Refrigerator Thin Steel 25 HP Shipping Container Thin Steel 25 HP Sofa Thick Plaster/Foam/Plastic 15 HP Statue Thin Stone 20 HP Tree Thick Wood 20 HP Utility Pole Thick Concrete 25 HP Wardrobe Thin Wood 5 HP Windshield 0 HP (Not Cover) 0 HP Wooden Door Thin Wood 5 HP usinG shielDs Equipping and dropping a shield takes an Action. While you are using a hand to carry a shield, it cannot be used to do anything else. A shield is a movable source of cover, and while you wield a shield with HP remaining, you are considered to be in cover. When attacked by a target that you can see, you can interpose the shield between yourself and the attack. If you choose to do so, you cannot dodge the attack at all, though a Ranged Attack can still miss you due to your opponent's poor marksmanship. The shield takes the entire attack to its HP. If a shield hits 0 HP it is destroyed (until repaired if inorganic), and cannot be used as cover, though it still remains equipped to your hand until you use an Action to drop it. This table also gives you a good benchmark for how much damage walls and doors can take before you break them down. 184 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT Shield Type Shield Description Hit Points (HP) Cost Bulletproof Shield A transparent polycarbonate shield that can protect you in a firefight. 10 100eb (Premium) Corpse Shield made of meat. Used to be a person. BODY STAT the corpse had in life. Depends on how many bullets you went through. humAn shielDs We all knew it would come to this. If you are already the Attacker in a Grapple, you can use an Action to \"equip\" the defender as a Human Shield if you are not already wielding a shield, using the same hand you are using to Grapple them. While you wield a Human Shield, you are considered in cover. Human Shields are more unwieldy than typical shields. Because of their squirming, Human Shields cannot be used to block Melee Attacks, or Ranged Attacks specifically targeted at your head using an Aimed Shot. When attacked by a target that you can see with a Ranged Attack not targeted at your head, you can interpose the Human Shield between yourself and the Ranged Attack. You can still attack your own Human Shield while you have them equipped, it's practically a tradition. Your Human Shield cannot dodge Ranged Attacks while you have them equipped, even if they have REF 8 or higher. When your Human Shield is shot, they take damage as if they had been shot normally. A Human Shield who dies while you have them equipped automatically becomes a shield with HP equal to their BODY. Unequipping a live Human Shield is as simple as ending your Grapple with them, which doesn't cost an Action, but dropping a corpse shield costs an Action just like any other shield. ARmoR Armor is rated by its Stopping Power, or SP, which is how well it can stop damage. It can be worn on either your body or your head, and it is advised that you wear both. Armor can be purchased for either the head or body locations. Wearing even a single piece of heavier armor will lower your REF, DEX, and MOVE by the most punishing Armor Penalty of armor you are wearing, a penalty which you only have to take once, even though you are likely wearing armor on both your body and head. This penalty can even leave your Character (if at MOVE 0) completely immobile. SP gained by armor does not \"stack,\" only your highest source of SP in a location determines your SP for that location. All your worn armor in a location is ablated simultaneously whenever you take damage. See pg. 186. how to ReAD the ARmoR tAble Armor Type: What we generally call it.

If you roll a 10, you automatically fail your Death Save. Every time you roll a Death Save, your Death Save Penalty increases, meaning each future Death Save you roll is made with an additional +1, making it progressively harder to stave off death. This Death Save Penalty continues to add up until you are brought back to 1HP by Stabilization, where it resets to your Base Death Save Penalty, which can be increased by the nastiest Critical Injuries.

You just want to know how to blow them up. stRuCtuRAl DAmAGe Points All vehicles have Structural Damage Points (SDP). As long as a vehicle has at least one SDP, it can still move. When it has no SDP left, the vehicle is considered Destroyed, is no longer considered cover, and cannot move unless it is repaired with the appro- priate Vehicle Tech Skill. Vehicles cannot dodge Attacks like a human, but while in a vehicle you can still dodge anything that you could typically dodge on foot when it's targeted at you instead of the vehicle. Shooting a vehicle with a ranged weapon still requires you to hit your shot using the range table. While in a vehicle, you can still be targeted with attacks through the glass, which has no HP and provides no cover. Bulletproof Glass is a Nomad Upgrade, see their Role Ability on pg. 163. AiminG FoR vehiCle weAk Points Every vehicle has weak points: areas which can be aimed for using an Aimed Shot. As an Action you can aim a single shot or Melee Attack at a vehicle's weak point, taking your whole Action and a -8 to your Check. If successful, you multiply the damage that gets through the vehicle's SP by 2. This is how you aim for the tires, engine, gas cap, etc. There's no reason not to aim for a weak point with a Melee Attack against a stationary vehicle because vehicles can't dodge and you automatically hit, but if the vehicle is moving, you must beat a DV13 to hit its weak point and the -8 penalty still applies. GettinG youR vehiCle stARteD Getting into a vehicle is an Action. Getting out of one is not, it's just movement. Starting a vehicle and Stopping a vehicle is an Action. If you have Interface Plugs, part of this Action can include connecting/ disconnecting them. Using Interface Plugs to drive a vehicle means you can drive it with no hands! Without Interface Plugs, one of your hands must be used for driving and can't be used to do anything else while you are driving. If you take this hand off the wheel, at the start of your next Turn you automatically Lose Control of the Vehicle (see pg. 192). 192 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT What this means is that you cannot get into a car and zoom off in the same 3-second Turn, which makes sense. When a Vehicle is started, three things happen: 1. The driver is placed immediately at the top of the Initiative Queue. 2. The Vehicle's MOVE STAT effectively becomes the driver's MOVE STAT. Any penalty the driver had to their MOVE doesn't affect the movement of the vehicle. 3. The driver becomes unable to use the Run Action. (I mean, why did you get into a vehicle in the first place, right?) bAsiC DRivinG Basic driving doesn't require a Skill Check if your REF + Relevant Control Skill is greater than 9. If yours isn't, basic driving requires you to use your Action every Turn to attempt a DV10 Check to maintain control of the vehicle using REF + Relevant Control Skill + 1d10. Failure means Losing Control of the Vehicle. This is why you probably don't let your kid drive in the first place. If your REF + Relevant Control Skill is greater than 9, Basic Driving doesn't require your Action, and oper- ates just the same as taking a Move Action outside of a vehicle, except your MOVE is much higher while driving. DoinG mAneuveRs in youR vehiCle The GM will decide when any non-basic driving you want to do will require a Maneuver. Maneuvers require your full attention, which in game terms means both your Action and your Move Action. Failing to beat the DV of the Check with REF + Relevant Control Skill + 1d10 will cause you to immediately Lose Control of the Vehicle. If screwing up couldn't cause you to lose control of the vehicle, it shouldn't require a Maneuver. Situations that require a Maneuver: Maneuver DV Swerve 13 Sharp Turn 13 Emergency Stop 13 Bootleg Turn 17 Do a Jump 17 Landing (Air Vehicle) 13 Aerobatic Maneuver (Air Vehicle) 17 losinG ContRol oF the vehiCle If you lose control of a vehicle, the GM decides your entire movement for the Turn you lose control. If your vehicle impacts something, it is treated as if you had rammed it. RAmminG Whenever you drive a vehicle into something with HP, be it a pedestrian, a piece of cover, or another vehicle, both your vehicle and the pedestrian, piece of cover, or other vehicle take 6d6 damage, and every- one involved in the crash (either as a pedestrian or a person in an involved vehicle) suffers the Whiplash Critical Injury. If the HP of any piece of cover or other vehicle you are ramming becomes 0 due to this damage, your movement can continue. Otherwise, your vehicle's movement must stop. You can always continue moving after you hit a pedestrian, but if they have more than 0 HP after impact, they can choose to now be on top of your vehicle if they want. ▶ Dodging a Ramming Vehicle ◀ Dodging a ramming vehicle on foot (to avoid the messy 6d6 damage) is only a DV13 Check to dodge with DEX + Evasion + 1d10. If successful, the dodger can choose to be on top of the vehicle if they want. 193 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT R eputation another kind of combat Not everything on The Street is determined with fists or guns. In a world where combat can end your life in a hot nanosecond, other methods have evolved to determine who is going to be the top dog in a conflict. One of these methods involves having a Reputation. Reputation is a measure of things your Character may do so well (or so badly) that they become well known for them. A Reputation for something is always established by a Character's actions, and is then awarded by the GM. When your GM believes your Character has done something worthy gaining a Reputation, they can assign them a Reputation Level from the table below. This is your Character's Reputation. While people may know of the other less impressive deeds your Character has accomplished, a new deed's Reputation will only replace the old one if the Level is higher. Most Cyberpunk RED Characters start with a Reputation of 0. ▶ RePutAtion Level Who Knows About You 1 Anyone who was there at the time knows. 2 Stories have gotten around to immediate friends. 3 All your co-workers and casual acquaintances know. 4 Stories are all over the local area. 5 Others beyond your local area recognize your name. 6 Others beyond your local area know you on sight. 7 A news story or two has been written about your exploits. 8 Your exploits regularly make the headlines and screamsheets. 9 Your exploits always make the screamsheets and TV. 10 You're known worldwide. Whenever your Character encounters new people in new situations, their Reputation may influence how those people react to them. When first meeting, Characters roll 1d10. A Character that rolls under the Reputation Level of the person they are meeting has heard of them. Sometimes this can be very good. Other times, it can be very bad, especially if you made lots of enemies while you were earning a Reputation. Reputation can also be a disadvantage. Whenever you do something extremely uncool (show cowardice, desert or betray an ally, etc.) the GM can still award you a Reputation Level for these actions. Reputation received from a negative event or action can replace the Reputation of a positive event or action. In that case, people are more likely to have heard about your uncool deeds rather than your impressive deeds (once again, roll 1d10). However, this time they won't be impressed; if your rep is for cowardice or something just as bad, it will work against you.BY EVE VENTRUE 194 FRIDAY NIGHT FIREFIGHT FACeDowns Reputation in Cyberpunk RED has one other big effect: Facedowns. A lot of combat in Cyberpunk RED comes down to a duel of wills—who's tougher, meaner, and looks more ready to prove it. This often leads to what are called Facedowns, when two heavies on The Street square off just before a fight or to see who'll back down from a confron- tation. The GM will call for a Facedown whenever they feel the scene calls for it. When making a Facedown, both participants will roll: COOL + Reputation* + 1d10 *If your defining Reputation Event is for cowardice your Reputation Level is treated as a negative number. In a tie, both parties are unsure and nothing happens. Otherwise, the loser has the option of either: Backing Down... or Taking a -2 to any future Actions made against this opponent due to fear until they have defeated them once facedown examPLe Rico Rico notices a punk spraying graffiti on the side of his apartment building, so he tells him to buzz off, hanging an Assault Rifle out the window and threatening to use it. The two have a Facedown. Each rolls COOL + Reputation + 1d10. Rico Rico wins because of his COOL and Reputation of 4 (He's known locally for an killer show he played last week). The punk decides to back down instead of trying to fight with his nerves all shaken up. i'm Just An i'm Just An angryangry ol' vet/ ol' vet/ i'm i'm aimingaiming stRAiGht FoR youR heAD/ stRAiGht FoR youR heAD/ Ain't Ain't nono ReAson sPeAkin' to you ReAson sPeAkin' to you iF we Ain't bReAkin' no bReAD.iF we Ain't bReAkin' no bReAD. — XerzeX— XerzeX from \"heave ho\" 195 BY NEIL BRANQUINHO netrunningnetrunning hacking in the time of the redhacking in the time of the red \"You patch in the last connection, making sure your wristplugs are tight.

Instantly, your consciousness is filled with the grey white static of the drop to \"online.\" Then with a sickening, falling sensation, you hurtle forward into a maze of shifting neon shapes and spinning grid lines...\" 196 NETRUNNING Well, it used to work that way. Now you slip on your Virtuality Goggles, mentally punch in the code, and shift seamlessly into NET space. And it looks just like it did in Meatspace. Except that now there's a strange meta-universe superimposed over that everyday vision, filled with shapes, patterns, and unearthly digital creatures. Welcome to the NET in the Time of the Red. W hy has the net changed? Core NET infrastructure got wrecked during the War. That included both land lines and sea cables, which were the main forms of communication links. The remaining NET was infested with all kinds of Black ICE from the War. The worst were the R.A.B.I.D.S., deadly AI constructs that hunted and killed anyone they encountered in the NET. Finally, Netwatch gave up and shut down the NET infrastructure. Computers remained linked only through dedicated land lines and laser lines. metA About 2035, a new programming language was developed. This was designed to unify all the different operating systems that were still in existence. This new language is called META and could be used in place of everything from C++ to simple Phone apps. META is what the current NET works on. Because it is a patch language much like LINUX, META is not very good at supporting graphics, so the huge graphical interfaces of the old NET couldn't be supported. So, now things look a little different. No, scratch that. Things look a lot different. But enough about that; we'll talk more on that topic later in this book. Meanwhile, let's get started with what you'll need to run the NET. W hat do I need to netrun? neuRAl link AnD inteRFACe PluGs All Netrunners have at least a little cyberware. To even use a Cyberdeck, you need to plug Interface Plugs into it, which also requires you have a Neural Link. See the Cyberware Section on pg. 359. CybeRDeCk Cyberdecks are the modular platforms that Programs and Hardware are installed on for the purpose of Netrunning. Both Programs and Hardware take up the same limited slots in your Cyberdeck. What distinguishes a powerful Cyberdeck from a cheaper one is the number of slots it has for Programs and Hardware. Type Cost Slots Poor Quality Cyberdeck 100eb (Premium) 5 Cyberdeck 500eb (Expensive) 7 Excellent Quality Cyberdeck 1,000eb (V.

If you did it the old school way, you would be stumbling around as all your senses would be fully in Cyberspace. Instead, modern Netrunners use Virtuality Goggles, headsets that project Cyberspace imagery over their view of the world that is actually around them. This means that you will be seeing and hearing things like Black ICE while your Meatspace team buddies will see nothing. But it also means you won't trip over the door sill when you sneak into the secret biolab.

Switching Cyberdecks requires a Meat Action. 197 NETRUNNING If you forget your Virtuality Goggles, you'll have to do it the old school way, which renders you effectively Unconscious until you Jack Out, as far as the meat world is concerned. PRoGRAms AnD hARDwARe These are the weapons and gear of Cyberspace. Programs are the tools a Netrunner uses to fight, protect, and explore the electronic realm. misCellAneous uPGRADes You'll probably want a few extra tools besides Virtuality Goggles and a Cyberdeck loaded with Programs and Hardware...but you don't really need anything else, so we'll talk about the extras later. D oing Things in the Net Being a Netrunner isn't easy. To survive you'll need to have mastery over your toolkit. So, read closely. meAt ACtions vs. net ACtions Netrunners have access to two kinds of Actions: Meat Actions (Non-Move Actions which take place in reality, or Meatspace) and NET Actions (which take place purely in the NET Architecture). On your Turn, you can take either a Meat Action or take as many NET Actions as your Interface (the Netrunner Role Ability) allows. No matter which you choose, you still get to take your Move Action. net ACtions The higher a Netrunner's Interface Rank, the more NET Actions they can take on their Turn. Interface is the Netrunner Role Ability. Without it, you cannot Netrun. Interface Rank 1-3 4-6 7-9 10 NET Actions 2 3 4 5 So, a Rank 1 Interface Netrunner can only use 2 NET Actions per Turn, while a Rank 4 Interface Netrunner can take up to 3 NET Actions per Turn. neT acTions examPLe Alloy Knight is a Netrunner. On his Turn he must decide if he wants to use his 3 NET Actions to continue progressing in the NET Architecture or if he wants to use a Meat Action to shoot the booster down the hall who has discovered him. Alloy decides to let his teammates handle the booster and chooses to use his 3 NET Actions instead. But first, he uses his Move Action to get behind cover, staying within the 6m/yd range of the access point. 198 NETRUNNING list oF net ACtions ▶ JACk in/out Enter or safely leave a NET Architecture when within 6 m/yds of an access point. Typically, a wall between you and the access point will block this Action. If you leave a NET Architecture without Jacking Out first, you'll be in a world of pain. ▶ use inteRFACe Ability All but one Interface Ability requires the use of at least one NET Action. See full rules on pg. 199. ▶ ACtivAte/DeACtivAte PRoGRAm Activate or Deactivate one of your Programs. ▶ misCellAneous Very rarely, something you want to do in the NET won't fall into these categories. This is rare because the Virus Interface Ability lets you do almost anything you can dream to a NET Architecture pro- vided you are at the Architecture's lowest floor. If your GM allows you to do it, it will probably take a NET Action. whAt isn't A net ACtion? Doing anything in a NET Architecture requires the use of a NET Action, except for moving and saving copies of Files. ▶ Moving in a NET Architecture ◀ You can move as much as you want in a NET Architecture on your Turn. You can't move past a NET obstruction blocking you, like a Password. Pushing your luck will get you killed if you aren't careful. ▶ Saving a Copy of a File ◀ When you find a File in an Architecture, saving a copy into your Cyberdeck isn't a NET Action. JACkinG in oR out Using a NET Action, you can Jack In to a NET Architecture while within range (within 6 m/yds, blocked by walls) of one of its access points. Being jacked in is a prerequisite for doing anything in an Architecture. Moving out of the access point's range while jacked in to the Architecture jacks you out of the NET Architecture automatically, but leaves you vul- nerable: You suffer the effect of all remaining enemy Black ICE you've encountered, but not Derezzed, in the NET Architecture before you get \"out.\" Black ICE will be explained later (on pg. 204), but you don't want this to happen to you. It is much safer to use a NET Action to Jack Out from within the access point's range. Jacking Out \"resets\" the defenses of a NET Architecture, meaning you'll have to start your run over from the very beginning, which can only be done by jacking back in to the same location you originally entered and giving it another shot. All your Programs leave the Architecture with you when you Jack Out. If you want to have a perma- nent effect on the Architecture, you'll have to reach the bottom to leave a Virus. I nterface Abilities A Netrunner needs to know more than just how to activate Programs. Mastery of Interface Abilities is what separates weefle runners from the professionals they pretend to be. how to use youR inteRFACe Abilities Your Netrunner can use these Interface Abilities with their NET Actions (save for Scanner). Resolution for using any of these abilities (save for Zap) is as follows: Interface + 1d10 vs. DV 199 NETRUNNING inteRFACe Abilities ▶ sCAnneR Use a Meat Action to find out the Meatspace loca- tion of access points to any NET Architectures in an area. The higher the Check, the more you spot from further away. It is up to the GM's discretion to deter- mine how much you find. Example: The Netrunner uses their Scanner Ability to search the building for NET Architectures and their access points to hack using a Meat Action. Rolling a 1d10 and adding their Interface (7), they get a 14. With this roll, the GM determines that the Netrunner learns the Meatspace location of two of the nearby access points for the building's NET Architecture. ▶ bACkDooR Allows a Netrunner to attempt to break through Passwords in a NET Architecture using a NET Action. Of course, if you knew the password already, you automatically pass through the obstruction. Example: The Netrunner encounters a particularly difficult Password of DV10 blocking their progress while in an Architecture. Using a NET Action, they attempt to Backdoor it. They roll a d10 and add their Interface (7), getting a 16. The Password blocks the Netrunner no more. ▶ CloAk Allows you to hide traces of your presence and any Virus you left in the Architecture using a NET Action. The Pathfinder DV for another Netrunner to overcome your Cloak and discover your Actions is equal to the Cloak Check you made to create the Cloak. If you do not use the Cloak Ability before Jacking Out, another Netrunner can automatically discover what actions you took in the Architecture upon using the Pathfinder Ability. Example: After leaving their Virus on the Corporation's network, the Netrunner wants to hide any traces of their presence on the Architecture along with their Virus, so they use a NET Action to use their Cloak Ability. They roll Interface (7) + 1d10, getting a 16! An enemy Netrunner will have to beat this number with Interface + 1d10 before they can discover any traces of the Netrunner or be able to roll against any Virus that they left. If the Netrunner didn't leave such a flashy Virus, maybe the Corp wouldn't have even known that their NET Architecture was compromised! ▶ ContRol Allows you to control things attached to the NET Architectures like cameras, drones, turrets, laser grids, elevators, sprinklers, etc., using a Control Node. Each Node has a DV required to take control of it as a NET Action. Operating each individual thing attached to the node requires a separate NET Action once you have taken hold of the Control Node, and can be done from anywhere in the Architecture as long as you are still in control of the Control Node. Each Control Node can only be activated once per Turn. The DV to wrest a Control Node currently held by another Netrunner or a Demon is equal to the Control Check they made to take control of it. You lose control of any Control Nodes you hold in an Architecture when you Jack Out. Example: In an Architecture, a Netrunner encoun- ters a DV10 Control Node that manages the cameras on this floor. By using a NET Action to use their Control Ability they roll Interface (7) + 1d10 and beat the Control Node's DV by 2. Now that they've taken control of the Control Node, they use an additional NET Action to reposition the cameras so that they will not capture the Netrunner's friends while they sneak out of the fire escape. ▶ eye-Dee Allows you to know what a found piece of data (like a File) is and its value using a NET Action. Some Files have a DV that must be beaten to learn anything from them. Example: After discovering an interestingly titled File, the Netrunner uses their Eye-Dee Ability with a NET Action. It's a DV9 File, so the Netrunner rolls Interface (7) + 1d10 and easily rolls higher than 9. Unfortunately, the File was a dummy left in the Architecture just to waste a Netrunner's time! ▶ PAthFinDeR Uses a NET Action to partially reveal the \"map\" of the NET Architecture. The higher your roll, the more you learn. This tells you generally what is in the NET 200 NETRUNNING Architecture you have just broken into, but not the DV of anything. You can see into the Architecture a number of floors equal to your Check or up to the first obstruction (usually a Password) with a DV higher than your Pathfinder Check, whichever happens first. Example: After jacking into a new NET Architecture, the Netrunner has no idea what they might be up against, so they use their Pathfinder Ability with a NET Action to find out. Rolling their Interface + 1d10, they only get a 10. The GM determines they learn only the first 3 floors of the elevator, because the third has a DV11 Password on it that blocks their view. ▶ sliDe Attempt to flee combat with a single Non-Demon Black ICE Program as a NET Action. If you are able to roll a successful Slide Check against the Program's Perception + 1d10 you can escape the Black ICE to an adjacent floor of the elevator, but not past a Password or other NET obstruction. A Black ICE Program that has been successfully slid away from stops following the Netrunner and becomes a Black ICE laying in wait right where it was slid away from. You can only attempt to Slide once per Turn. You can't Slide preemptively. Example: In the middle of a painful conflict with a Hellhound Black ICE a Netrunner decides that they really don't have the time to get killed right now. Using a NET Action they attempt to Slide away from the Black ICE, rolling Interface (7) + 1d10 vs. the Hellhound's Perception (6) + 1d10. The Netrunner gets 14 to the Hellhound's 13. Success! The Netrunner escapes to the next floor of the elevator... Unfortunately, there is another Hellhound waiting there. This Netrunner really should have used Pathfinder! They can't Slide again until their next Turn! ▶ viRus Once you have reached the lowest level of the NET Architecture you can leave your own Virus in the Architecture to perform up to 2 actions or changes, within reason. Using this ability is the only way a Netrunner can make a change to a NET Architecture that persists after they Jack Out. Describe to the GM what you want the virus to do, and they will assign a DV. A more powerful Virus will require a higher DV to leave in the Architecture, as determined by the GM. Depending what you want to do, this can require as many NET Actions as the GM determines. Roll a Virus Check. The DV to destroy a Virus is equal to the Virus Check made to create it. Example: After reaching the lowest level of an Architecture, the Netrunner wants to leave it worse than they found it. They explain to the GM that they want to leave a Virus in the Architecture that changes all the passwords in the Architecture every 5 minutes. The GM determines that placing such a Virus would take 9 NET Actions to leave in the Architecture and assigns a DV12. Over their next 3 Turns, the Netrunner spends all 3 of their NET Actions to complete the Virus, then rolls Interface (7) + 1d10... rolling only a 12. Their code just doesn't work so they decide to try again, spending another 9 NET Actions over another 3 Turns to try again, succeeding this time with a 15. When the Corporation later discovers the Netrunner's Virus, their Netrunner gets a headache while trying to clean up the DV15 Virus. Virus examPLes Here's some inspiration for Viruses and the time and DVs they might require to achieve. Virus which forcibly alters the icon of all Asp Black ICE installed into the Architecture from fierce serpents into cute little sneks wearing tiny party hats. DV6; 1 NET Action. Virus which completely deactivates a particular Black ICE installed in the Architecture until the Virus is destroyed. DV10; 2 NET Actions. Virus which causes a Control Node to mal- function until the Virus is destroyed. DV10; 2 NET Actions. Virus which deletes all Black ICE installed in the Architecture permanently. DV 12; 10 NET Actions. Virus that causes cat- astrophic and lasting d a m a g e t o t h e N e t Architecture itself, halving the number of available floors permanently. DV 12; 10 NET Actions. 201 NETRUNNING ▶ ZAP Allows you to make an attack as a NET Action against a Program or enemy Netrunner. If you are able to roll a successful Zap Check against the Program's Defense Value + 1d10 or the Netrunner's Interface + 1d10, you deal 1d6 damage to the Program's REZ or directly to the Netrunner's brain. Example: A Netrunner, who already used all their Attacker Programs this Turn, still hasn't managed to finish off a Hellhound. Luckily, they have one NET Action left, so they Zap it. Rolling Interface (7) + 1d10 vs. the Hellhound's Defense (2) + 1d10 they beat the Hellhound, and deal 1d6 damage to the Hellhound's REZ, finishing it off. n et combat When it comes to violence in the NET, here's how it goes down: Your Interface + Program ATK + 1d10 or Black ICE ATK + 1d10 vs. Target's Interface + 1d10 or Program DEF/Black ICE DEF + 1d10 On a Hit, the Target suffers the Effect of the Program A Program whose Class specifies a type of target (like Anti-Personnel or Anti-Program) is only effective when used against its intended target. DeFeAtinG A PRoGRAm A Program is Derezzed when it is lowered to 0 REZ (Hit Points), but this doesn't remove it from your deck or the NET Architecture. The Program is still considered to be \"running,\" it has just been hobbled to the point of uselessness. In order to get it back to full REZ and operating condition, you'll have to spend 2 NET Actions: one to Deactivate it, and one to activate it again. Attack Programs are an exception. They are Activated when making an Attack and, once used, automatically Deactivate themselves. Unless of course the Program was Destroyed, in which case it is 100% erased (and is no longer Rezzed). You will need to buy a new one. You don't need to hold a funeral, but you could. P ROGRAMS Programs are the tools a Netrunner uses to fight, protect, and explore the electronic realm. Activating or Deactivating a Program is a NET Action. Each Program loaded on your Cyberdeck can only be Activated once per Meatspace Round. A Program that is currently Activated (Rezzed) cannot be Activated again until it is Deactivated. Attack programs Deactivate themselves once used. You can run multiple copies of the same Program on your Cyberdeck if you wish to get around this limitation, and their effects will stack if they are run simultaneously, unless mentioned otherwise.

If it beats your Check, you (or one of your active Programs at random in the case of Anti-Program Black ICE) suffer its effect immedi- ately. It is then placed into the Initiative Queue at the top, one number above the entity with the previously highest Initiative. On each of its Turns, it will attack the Netrunner (or one of their active Programs at random in the case of Anti-Program Black ICE) once, rolling its ATK + 1d10 vs the Netrunner's Interface + 1d10 (or Program's DEF + 1d10 if it's an Anti-Program Black ICE), doing its Effect should it succeed. Black ICE will chase its target through the entire Architecture until it is Derezzed or is eluded by a Netrunner who successfully used the Slide Interface Ability. Anti-Program Black ICE will continue to follow an enemy Netrunner until they are Derezzed or Slid away from even if they currently have no Programs Rezzed, as they are coded to view enemy Netrunners as a Program source. Black ICE that are eluded by a Netrunner's Slide Ability stop following their target and become a Black ICE \"lying in wait\" in the Architecture exactly where their pursuit ended, as described above. When a Netrunner Activates a Black ICE of their own using a NET Action, they can do so in one of two ways. The first is to activate their Black ICE to lie in wait at their current \"floor\" in the Architecture to act as described above. This can't be done in combat. The second is to activate their Black ICE during combat targeting a valid target. In this case, the Black ICE is placed into the Initiative Queue at the top, one number above the entity with the previously highest Initiative. It attacks its target once every Turn, until it is Derezzed, Destroyed, or Slid away from successfully. To assign a new target to their Black ICE, the Netrunner needs to spend a NET Action to Deactivate it, and a NET Action to Activate it again, re-entering it into the top of the Initiative Queue and sending it at a valid target. Your Black ICE is just as single-minded as the Black ICE you encounter. Black ICE is not a digital pet; it cannot do anything except the one thing it was coded to do.

It could be a Program, Black ICE, another Netrunner, File, Control Node, etc. Every Turn you can go down through the Architecture as many floors as you want, assuming you aren't blocked by a Password or other NET obstruction. You don't get to skip any floors. You still have only a limited number of NET Actions every Turn. How you use them says a lot about your risk tolerance and style of Netrunning. You have to open every door in order... and behind plenty of them, there's a Black ICE that will attempt to punish you immediately for opening its door unless you are fast enough, and will enter at the top of the Initiative Queue even if you were faster. How far can you press your luck? Do you take things slowly, defeating each Black ICE as you encounter them, or will you Slide recklessly, even into danger, riskily opening door after door, dodging the initial attacks of all Black ICE lying in wait for you, and safely Jacking Out with your final NET Action before the Black ICE you've left active in the NET Architecture even get a chance to take a Turn? ▶ exAmPle net ARChiteCtuRe Floor On the Other Side of the \"Door\" DV 1 File (Eye-Dee DV6) 2 Password (Backdoor DV8) 3 Control Node (Cameras) (Control DV10) 4 Password (Backdoor DV8) 5 Asp N/A 6 Control Node (Security Door) (Control DV10) 7 Hellhound N/A B uilding a NET architecture B u ild i n g a N E T a r c h it e c tu r e Step by Step creation for gmS Creating a NET Architecture for your Netrunner Player is simple. You could generate one on the fly if needed, but you probably want to do this ahead of time. Once you've decided on a NET Architecture Difficulty Rating that fits what you are looking for, the rest is as simple as 1, 2, 3. noTes on archiTecTures Many electronics do not have a NET Architecture, either because they are analog, like many toasters still are, or operate entirely on the CitiNet and memory chips, like Agents and Video Cameras do. These types of electronic devices can still be countered using the Electronics/Security Tech Skill, but since they don't need a NET Architecture to operate, they can't be hacked with the Interface Role Ability. This is why many Netrunners have good Electronics/Security Tech Skills to complement their Netrunning. Cyberware can't be hacked using Interface for the same reason, but is governed by the Cybertech skill instead. GMs should keep in mind the type of operation setting up an Architecture. If all someone needs from their NET Architecture is some simple Control Nodes and an Imp to work the sound and lighting in their nightclub, security may not be a priority. Just like in the real world, people in Cyberpunk build based on balancing budget and supporting what's needed to run their operation efficiently. 210 NETRUNNING steP 0: the DiFFiCulty RAtinG Depending on how hardcore the NET Architecture you are creating is, its defenses will be accordingly tough. Controlling the Difficulty Rating is a good way to make sure your NET Architecture will challenge your Netrunner (giving them a fighting chance) without outright killing them. A Standard Difficulty Rating is a good place to start. Basic Difficulty Standard Difficulty Uncommon Difficulty Advanced Difficulty Password/File/Control Node DV DV6 DV8 DV10 DV12 Interface of a Netrunner with a fighting chance 2 4 6 8 Interface of a Netrunner who might die before reaching the bottom N/A 2 or less 4 or less 6 or less steP 1: shAPe the ARChiteCtuRe Roll 3d6. This is the total number of floors the Architecture will have. Roll a d10; If you got 7 or higher, the Architecture has a branch in it. Roll that d10 again to see if you get another branch. When you don't, stop. Split up the total number of floors between the main branch and any branches you've rolled, according to your taste. A NET Architecture cannot branch until after the second floor in the main branch. Make sure that there is also a longest branch in the Architecture, so that there is a defined \"bottom\" to the NET Architecture, where a Netrunner can leave a Virus. steP 2: Fill in the ARChiteCtuRe See the NET Architecture Difficulty Value table, just above, and decide on the NET Architecture Difficulty Rating you want. Keep in mind the Interface Rank of your Netrunner Player Character. Start at the highest floor of the Architecture and work your way down. For the first two floors in the NET Architecture, roll on the Lobby table below to determine what can be found on each floor, re-rolling any Program or Password entries already rolled. Continue working your way down. For the remaining floors of the NET Architecture, roll on the NET Architecture Body table that corresponds to the Difficulty Rating you assigned to the Architecture to determine what can be found on each floor, re-rolling any Program or Password entries already rolled. Using this method, the deeper a Netrunner ventures into a NET Architecture, the more likely they are to find valuable Files or useful Control Nodes. steP 3: Fit the ARChiteCtuRe to the woRlD ARounD it For every File or Control Node in the Architecture you've generated, make sure it has a reason to exist in the Meatspace that the Architecture is installed in. Files and Control Nodes are the \"treasure\" of Netrunning, so it's important to make their impact on gameplay and the world a real one that makes sense given the location they are found in. Somebody important in the building will probably know the Passwords for the Architecture. Of course, they won't share such information openly. A Control Node doesn't have to be entirely combat-oriented either. Cameras, sprinklers, sirens, assembly line conveyor belts, video display feeds, chlo- rination control valves, electronically engaged door locks, massage chairs, soda machines, air conditioning, and pitching machines all make great Control Nodes too. 211 NETRUNNING If there are Control Nodes in the Architecture, decide what they are and if a Demon is present to operate them. Any Active Defenses will need a Demon present to run them. Try to fit the Demon to its location. When in doubt, Imps are commonplace. The local movie theater's NET Architecture probably isn't running a Balron unless it's hiding something. In the spirit of fitting the Architecture to its Meatspace location, feel free to replace any Program you've gener- ated with another Program of the same Cost and swap around any floors you've generated in the Architecture. Or, instead of rolling, pick whichever floors you want in step two for a more custom approach that also maintains game balance. Sparingly, you can even pick a floor from a NET Architecture from one Difficulty Rating higher than the one you are currently generating to make a \"Boss Floor\" of sorts. ▶ net ARChiteCtuRe: FiRst two FlooRs (the lobby) Roll Lobby Floor 1 File DV6 2 Password DV6 3 Password DV8 4 Skunk 5 Wisp 6 Killer ▶ net ARChiteCtuRe: All otheR FlooRs Roll (3d6) Basic Floor Standard Floor Uncommon Floor Advanced Floor 3 Hellhound Hellhound x2 Kraken Hellhound x3 4 Sabertooth Hellhound, Killer Hellhound, Scorpion Asp x2 5 Raven x2 Skunk x2 Hellhound, Killer Hellhound, Liche 6 Hellhound Sabertooth Raven x2 Wisp x3 7 Wisp Scorpion Sabertooth Hellhound, Sabertooth 8 Raven Hellhound Hellhound Kraken 9 Password DV6 Password DV8 Password DV10 Password DV12 10 File DV6 File DV8 File DV10 File DV12 11 Control Node DV6 Control Node DV8 Control Node DV10 Control Node DV12 12 Password DV6 Password DV8 Password DV10 Password DV12 13 Skunk Asp Killer Giant 14 Asp Killer Liche Dragon 15 Scorpion Liche Dragon Killer, Scorpion 16 Killer, Skunk Asp Asp, Raven Kraken 17 Wisp x3 Raven x3 Dragon, Wisp Raven, Wisp, Hellhound 18 Liche Liche, Raven Giant Dragon x2 212 NETRUNNING D emons and Defenses a toolbox for gamemaSterS One way to spice up a NET Architecture location is by loading it up with Defenses. You might want to look into installing a Demon into the Architecture to control them. Demons In the Time of the Red, what we call \"Demons\" are actually very specific types of Black ICE Intelligent Systems. They are not the True AIs of the pre-War period, which were restricted after the destruction they wrought during the 4th Corporate War. These \"Demons\" are designed to attack Meatspace targets, such as a Netrunner's support party, using Control Nodes, like drones and turrets. Demons have an Interface and a Combat Number. This Combat Number combines both STAT and Skill for them. You add a d10 roll to this Combat Number for the purpose of attacking and defending with drones, turrets, etc., which they are Controlling. They are unable to run Programs or Black ICE. With their Interface, Demons have access to only 2 Netrunner Abilities with which to use their NET Actions: Zap (to defend themselves) and Control (to operate Control Nodes). Even when operated by a Demon, each Control Node can still only be activated once per Turn. Demons can have control of multiple Control Nodes just like Netrunners. That's why Arasaka installs multiple turrets. A Demon is constantly aware of every facet of its Architecture, which means that it is unimpeded by Passwords, is always aware of any Netrunner's presence, and automatically wins any Speed contest against a Program. Thus, Demons have no SPD or PER score. Because of this, you cannot Slide away from a Demon, and the Demon doesn't have a chance to get a free hit on you when it discovers you. Demons don't have DEF either, and defend just as a Netrunner does with Interface + 1d10. A Demon enters the Initiative Queue at the top when it detects an intruder with one of its Observation Cameras, or when a Netrunner enters its Architecture. On their Turn, Demons prioritize acting on Control Node triggers using their NET Actions, and only Zap an enemy Netrunner with their leftover NET Actions. The biggest limit of a Demon is its specific, non-vo- litional \"intelligence.\" Demons are rather like the AI used in video games; they have \"triggers\" that set up predetermined actions they can take. For instance, a Demon controlling a turret knows to attack anyone who enters a specific room who is not wearing a specific ID badge. This is all it cares about. If the marketing manager's ID badge had been unknowingly replaced with the wrong ID, the Demon would treat them just like any other intruder. ▶ Demons Name REZ Interface NET Actions Combat Number Imp 15 3 2 14 Icon: Small orange sphere of light with red horns.

Description: A description of the Defense. Some will offer a number of different options for the GM to choose from when building the Defense. The DV for countering the Defense with Electronics/Security Tech (and the amount of time it takes) is also located here. Default Trigger: The most common method of acti- vating the Defense. GMs should feel free to modify it to their own needs. 213 NETRUNNING Data: Additional notes can be found here. This can include MOVE for Active Defenses, Combat Number for Emplaced Defenses, range of operation, HP, the Perception Check to spot a Defense for Environmental Defenses, and any information about ROF. ACtive DeFenses Active Defenses are small robots capable of independent action within an area. Like autonomous vehicles, they can follow a target over a long distance, usually up to the perimeter of the defended site, such as a building or a fenced/enclosed area. Unless they are being controlled manually by a Netrunner, Active Defenses require a Demon controlling their Control Node in the Architecture to stay operational. When an Active Defense isn't being controlled, it is vulnerable to being countered using the Electronics/ Security Tech Skill. Once countered, the Active Defense can be controlled remotely within 6m/yds of one of the NET Architecture's access points with an Agent using an Action in the same manner that a Netrunner does with their Interface Ability, Control. When controlled by a Netrunner, all attacks and defenses are made using the Netrunner's own Skills as if they were firing its weapons in their own hands and dodging with their own body.

They are considered \"active\" defenses in as much as their programming requires a set of predetermined conditions that then trigger an attack. Each is connected to its own Control Node in a NET Architecture. Unlike Active Defenses, Emplaced Defenses do not require a Demon or Netrunner to operate them. When acting on their own without being controlled by a Demon, they use their Combat Number, which combines both STAT and Skill for them, to which you add a 1d10. Emplaced defenses can't dodge attacks because they are stationary. When an Emplaced Defense isn't being controlled, it is vulnerable to being countered using the Electronics/ Security Tech Skill. Once countered, the Emplaced Defense can be controlled remotely within 6m/yds of one of the NET Architecture's Access Points with an Agent using an Action in the same manner that a Netrunner does with their Interface Ability, Control. When controlled by a Netrunner, all attacks are made using the Netrunner's own Skills as if they were firing its weapons in their own hands. Type Description Default Trigger Data Automated Blood Swarm Automated weapon disperses a swarm of nanites into the room as a red fog. The nanites, when inhaled, attack their victim from within by binding the hemoglobin in their blood into clots. Anything that filters gas attacks blocks the Automated Blood Swarm. Everyone Meat within the Defended Area must succeed at a DV15 Resist Torture/ Drugs Check. Anyone who fails is dealt 3d6 damage directly to their HP. Their armor isn't ablated. DV21 Electronics/Security Tech, 5 min to counter. Target enters room without wearing proper pass or badge. Single Attack on all targets Perimeter of Defended Area Automated Melee Weapon An automated Very Heavy Melee Weapon, typically attacking from one corner of a room. Often, it takes the form of an industrial-grade water cutter or spinning Monofilament wire. DV17 Electronics/Security Tech, 5 min to counter. Target enters room without wearing proper pass or badge. Melee Weapon continues to attack until all targets are dead or no longer in range, or proper badge is presented. Combat Number 14 25HP Perimeter of Defended Area Automated Turret This is an automated weapon, usually implanted in the ceiling of a room for best coverage. Most Ranged Weapons can be installed as an Automated Turret, although typically they will be equipped with 1 of the following: • Assault Rifle with 25 Basic Bullets • Flamethrower with 4 Incendiary Shotgun Shells • Dartgun with 8 Poison Arrows • Very Heavy Pistol with 8 Armor Piercing Bullets • Heavy SMG with 40 Basic Bullets DV17 Electronics/Security Tech, 5 min to counter. Target enters room without wearing proper pass or badge. Turret continues to fire until target is dead, or no longer in range, or proper badge is presented. Combat Number 14 25HP Perimeter of Defended Area enviRonmentAl DeFenses Environmental Defenses are systems that are \"built into\" a specific part of the everyday environment. They are usually spread over a limited space, such as a hallway, room, or relatively small enclosed/fenced space. Many of these are either part of the structure of the floors, walls, or ceilings, or have emitters/projectors built into those spaces. Environmental Defenses will each have their own Control Nodes in a NET Architecture. They are all 215 NETRUNNING automatic, and even when controlled by a Demon or a Netrunner can only be toggled ON or OFF, and always Activate exactly on their trigger. When a Demon isn't present, turning on the Electrical Flooring at night before they leave is somebody in the building's job. When an Environmental Defense isn't being controlled, it is vulnerable to being countered using the Electronics/ Security Tech Skill. Once countered, the Environmental Defense can be controlled remotely within 6m/yds of one of the NET Architecture's Access Points with an Agent using an Action in the same manner that a Netrunner does with their Interface Ability, Control. Type Description Default Trigger Data Observation Cameras These cameras can see in Low Light, Infrared, and UV, and report images for a Demon or security personnel to act on. DV9 Electronics/Security Tech, 1 min to counter. Target enters room. 5HP Perception DV17 to spot Can see one entire room or corridor Tanglefoot Flooring This is a network of nanowire concealed in a seemingly normal carpet. When triggered, the wires extend and wrap around the feet and legs of the target, reducing their MOVE by 1d6 until the carpet is destroyed or they get off the carpet. DV13 Electronics/Security Tech, 1 min to counter. Target steps onto the carpet. 20HP Perception DV17 to spot 1 ROF Perimeter of Defended Area Electrical Flooring This is a grid wired into a standard floor, which, when triggered, delivers a shocking 6d6 damage to the target's body, reduced by armor which it doesn't ablate. Target is shocked again at the end of their next Turn and each of their additional Turns until they get off the flooring. DV13 Electronics/Security Tech, 1 min to counter. Target steps onto the grid area. 20HP Perception DV17 to spot Perimeter of Defended Area Laser Grid Laser grid projected from the ceiling and walls in a tight pattern. Treat touching one of the lasers like getting hit in the body with a Very Heavy Melee Weapon. If perceived, the Laser Grid can be crossed safely with a DV17 Contortionist Check, touching a laser on a failure. DV17 Electronics/Security Tech, 5 min to counter. Target steps into the Defended Area or moves 2m/yds within the Defended Area. Perception DV17 to spot Perimeter of Defended Area Tip-floor A section of this floor is counter-weighted to drop the target into a pit trap below the floor. Targets can attempt to save themselves from falling with a DV15 Athletics Check. No Check is required if target has a Grapple Hand or Grapple Gun easily accessible. The bottom of the pit may have a grid of nanowire or spikes delivering 6d6 damage to the target's body, which is reduced by armor. DV13 Electronics/Security Tech, 1 min to counter. Target steps onto the tip-floor. Perception DV17 to spot Perimeter of Defended Area Goop This is a series of sprayers that when triggered project a thick goo around the feet and legs of the target, reducing their MOVE by 2d6 until the goop is destroyed or they otherwise escape the Defended Area. DV13 Electronics/Security Tech, 1 min to counter. Target steps into the spray area. 10HP Perception DV17 to spot 1 ROF Perimeter of Defended Area Ceiling/Wall Punchers Steel rods that slam down in a grid from the ceiling, or out from the wall crushing targets beneath/between them with 6d6 damage to their body, which is reduced by armor.

If you find yourself in need of automated home defense, reach deep into your wallet and look no further than your local Night Market. It all starts with buying your own NET Architecture. buyinG A net ARChiteCtuRe A NET Architecture will set you back considerably. The more floors you want, the more expensive the price per floor. Additionally, the length of the NET Architecture determines if the physical server that houses it is portable (the size of a large backpack) or not, and determines the maximum amount of Control Nodes (sold separately) you can install in it. Choose wisely, because you can't increase the number of floors in a NET Architecture after purchase. NET Architectures are only available for purchase at a Night Market that includes Personal Electronics, run by a Fixer of Rank 4 or higher. Number of Floors Maximum Control Nodes Portable?

No NET Architecture is immune to a crack infil- tration team you didn't see coming. Anything you install for defense could be possibly turned against you by a Netrunner or Tech of sufficient skill. So, just keep that in mind. Sometimes, being subtle with your security can be advantageous. Perhaps invest in control nodes to run cameras and an alarm, and a File to store the video logs, with some nasty Black ICE protecting it. If you need to send a message, focus on a security system that kills. Buy as many short Net Architectures as your Fixer can get a hold of, and fill them up to their control node limit with two Automated Turrets. Take advantage of your Fixer's connections to get some nice rocket launchers and fancy rockets to outfit your shiny new death machines. A Netrunner can't do any- thing unless they can get close enough. Make sure they die trying. 218 NETRUNNING ADDinG Demons AnD blACk iCe Now that you've got something to protect, you can fill your NET Architecture with Black ICE. To do so , you pay the cost of each Program you want to add individu- ally, and place them as you desire in open floors in your NET Architecture. Black ICE for NET Architecture use is priced exactly the same as Black ICE for Cyberdecks. If you want to add 2 Black ICE to a single floor, you pay double the cost of each Program you put in that floor. If you want to add 3 Black ICE to a single floor, you pay triple the cost of each Program you put in that floor. Demons are special and cannot be placed in doubles or triples. You can only have one Demon per six floors in your Architecture. See the table below for their prices.

They start with a 4 Floor NET Architecture (1,000eb/floor for 4000eb). On the first Floor they install a Hellhound (1,000eb) and a Killer (1,000eb). Each costs double because there's two on the same floor. On Floor 2 they install a Password with a DV8 (1,000eb). Floor 3 gets one more Hellhound (500eb because it is the only Black ICE on the floor) and the last Floor has a DV8 Control Node (1,000eb) that mans an Automated Turret (5,000eb).

All Critical Injuries cause a horrible Injury Effect and deal 5 Bonus Damage directly to the target's Hit Points when suffered. The Bonus Damage doesn't ablate armor and isn't modified by hit location. Critical Injuries and their Bonus Damage are inflicted regardless of if any of the attack's damage got through the target's SP. whaT To do when a characTer dies What's a GM to do when one of PCs takes the Big Drop? Here's a few ways to deal with this: P re p a re f o r t h e worst: Early on in the campaign, have your players start developing an alternate Character to pick up the torch should the original go down. This could be a relative, a close friend, or even an old lover. It always helps if they knew the deceased PC and can slide into the Crew with a minimum amount of disruption. Expect the End: The other way is to psychologi- cally prepare the Players to expect death. This is what Mike calls the \"samurai do not fear death\" option. Cyberpunk, in all its incarnations, has a repu- tation for being a deadly RPG to play (there are even jokey cartoons about it). So, set the Players up, from the beginning, to expect sudden and brutal death. Sell the idea that when they go, they will go out as heroes in a blaze of glory; and when it happens, do whatever you can to make that death a scene everyone at the table will remember and talk about for days. 221 TRAUMA TEAM ▶ CRitiCAl inJuRies to the boDy Roll (2d6) Injury Injury Effect Quick Fix Treatment 2 Dismembered Arm The Dismembered Arm is gone.

DeAth sAves At the start of each of your Turns where you are Mortally Wounded, you must make a Death Save. Roll a d10. If you roll under your BODY, you live, and can take your Turn as usual. If you roll a 10, you automatically fail your Death Save. Every time you roll a Death Save, your Death Save Penalty increases, meaning each future Death Save you roll is made with an additional +1, making it progressively harder to stave off death. This Death Save Penalty continues to add up until you are brought back to 1HP by Stabilization, where it resets to your Base Death Save Penalty, which can be increased by the nastiest Critical Injuries. If you fail even a single Death Save, you die. And there's no coming back from that. S tabilization and Healing Assuming you don't end up dead, you'll want to heal up so you can get back on The Street and do it all over again. To begin the natural healing process, you must first receive stabilization. The DV to Stabilize a target (or yourself) depends on what Wound State your target is in. Lightly Wounded: DV10 Seriously Wounded: DV13 Mortally Wounded: DV15 Stabilization takes an Action and is rolled: TECH + First Aid Skill or Paramedic Skill + 1d10. i'm stAbiliZeD. now whAt? Once successful stabilization has been reached, the target will heal a number of Hit Points equal to their BODY for each full day they spend resting, spending 223 TRAUMA TEAM the majority of each day taking it easy and doing only light activity, until they are at Full HP again. If the patient pushes it, they will gain no HP that day, their wounds will reopen, and they will need to receive sta- bilization again to restart the natural healing process. ...unless you'Re moRtAlly wounDeD A Mortally Wounded target who receives successful stabilization is immediately healed to 1 Hit Point and is now Unconscious. Their adrenaline has run out. While unconscious, you are gone from the world. This condition always lasts one minute. You still roll Death Saves if somebody stabs you into a Mortally Wounded state while you are unconscious. Happens more than you think. neeDeD skills There are four healing Skills in Cyberpunk RED: Cybertech, First Aid, Paramedic (x2), and Surgery. ▶ CybeRteCh • Not capable of Stabilizing Wound States. • Can be used to Quick Fix and Treat Critical Injuries done to cyberware that have replaced meat parts like cyberlimbs or cybereyes. ▶ FiRst AiD • Capable of Stabilizing Wound States and Quick Fixing only the most common Critical Injuries. • Available to all Characters with minimal invest- ment because it is always trained to at least +2. ▶ PARAmeDiC (x2) • Capable of Stabilizing Wound States and Quick Fixing or Treating all but the deadliest Critical Injuries. • Available to all Characters but is a costly invest- ment as it is a (x2) cost Skill. ▶ suRGeRy • Capable of Treating even the deadliest Critical Injuries. • Available only to Medtechs through their Role Ability, Medicine. tReAtinG A CRitiCAl inJuRy There are two ways to heal a Critical Injury: a Quick Fix and a Treatment. Depending on the severity of the Critical Injury, either option may not be available, or they may require different skills. The worst Critical Injuries require the Surgery Skill, which is exclusive to the Medtech Role Ability. A Quick Fix will remove the Injury Effect for the rest of the day. Each attempt takes a minute. You can Quick Fix yourself. A Treatment will remove the Injury Effect permanently. Each attempt takes four hours. You can't do a Treatment on yourself. CRitiCAl inJuRies AnD CybeRteCh If you suffer a Critical Injury to a section of your body that has been replaced with cyberware (Cyberarm, Cyberleg, Cybereye, Cyberaudio, etc.) you still suffer the Effect of the Critical Injury and its Bonus Damage. However, you can use the Cybertech Skill to perform a Quick Fix or Treatment in place of the First Aid, Paramedic, or Surgery Skills. This Check is made at the listed DV and takes the same amount of time. T rauma Team: Silver or exec? As demand for their services rose, the Trauma Team changed their funding model to reflect the times, offer- ing 2 levels of service for their clients: Silver (500eb/ month) and Executive (1,000eb/month). Silver members are charged for Treatments requiring Surgery equal to the cost that they would be charged at the Hospital. If the member doesn't want to pay extra for these Treatments, the Trauma Team will do everything possible for them using the Paramedic Skill before dropping them off at the nearest hospital. 224 TRAUMA TEAM Executive coverage includes Treatments requiring Surgery at no extra cost. Both plans are transferable on a 1-1 basis meaning you can use your coverage to help one of your friends without coverage, but not for two friends simultaneously, or if you've already called in your coverage for yourself. Registering your Trauma Team Card on an Agent with a linked Biomonitor will allow your Agent to call the Trauma Team on your behalf during a firefight without you needing to take an Action to do so when you have HP less than your BODY or whenever you receive a Critical Injury that dismembers a body part. If you register your Trauma Team Card to a friend's Agent, their Agent will be able to call for their injuries as above, but on your plan. Otherwise, calling the Trauma Team is an Action, and can be done whenever you are injured. If you piss them off by calling them for extremely minor injuries, they might forget to respond to your next call. Upon calling the Trauma Team, you roll a d6. The result is how many Rounds before the Trauma Team arrives. They then join at the top of the Initiative Queue. The Trauma Team are treated like the Lawman's Backup, meaning that in addition to SP, HP, and a MOVE, and BODY score, they have a Combat Number, which is used for both offense and defense. This number combines both STAT and Skill for them. You add a d10 roll to this value whenever attacking with their carried weapons or equipment or defending. The Trauma Team members cannot dodge bullets. A Trauma Team consists of 5 members: A Doctor, a Medical Assistant, a Pilot, and 2 Trauma Team Security Officers. They arrive from the air in an AV-4 equipped with a Vehicle Heavy Weapon Mount loaded with a Tsunami Arms Helix (see pg. 347). The AV-4 is also packed with medical tech, including 4 Cryotanks and a state-of-the-art operating table. The Trauma Team prides themselves on arriving in their AV-4 as close to the action as possible and getting all patients safely into Cryopump bags on the same Turn that they arrive in combat if possible, after which they leave under covering fire just as soon as all policy holders are secured in the AV-4.

Because of this, costs have come down significantly. When you check into a hospital, you are only charged for the Highest DV Stabilization or Treatment required to heal you fully. Everything else to start the natural healing process is thrown in at no extra charge. Likely, you'll walk out of the hospital the same day you walked in, to finish the healing process in the comfort of your home. If you'd rather heal in the hospital, beds are 100eb (Premium) a night. If you can't pay your hospital bill when you leave, the hospital can work out a payment plan with you where you can pay your bill at the beginning of the next month. People who don't pay their medical bills on time risk collection agents being sent after them, which isn't something anybody wants. Here's what a trip to the hospital will cost: Highest DV of Stabilization or Treatment for Critical Injury During Visit Cost DV17 or higher 1,000eb (V. Expensive) DV15 500eb (Expensive) DV13 100eb (Premium) DV10 50eb (Costly) 226 TRAUMA TEAM boDybAnk Widespread adoption of new advances in limb cloning technology pioneered by Biotechnica during the 4th Corporate War crashed the market for real human cadavers. Cloned limbs became so numerous that for the first time in the history of organ harvesting, people became worth less dead than alive. The Bodybank had to evolve its business model to keep afloat, pivoting itself into a provider of cloned limbs to hospital clients. As part of this pivot, the Bodybank stopped offering money for both legitimate and illegitimate limbs. The cost for a replacement limb is now included in the cost of a hospital visit. Buying your own to keep cryochilled for \"just in case\" costs only 50eb (Costly) a limb. FounD CybeRwARe Cyberware reclaimed from cadavers has resale value on the market, provided it is prop- erly harvested. Only a Medtech is capable of harvesting cyberware (except those easily removable with an Action, like Chipware or Cyberlimbs with Quick Change Mounts) from a corpse without destroying it in the process (destroyed cyberware has no value on the market, but it could always be repaired with the Cybertech Skill), and the DV to do so is equal to the DV to install the cyberware in a new body. Both procedures take 4 hours, and if failed, destroy the cyberware and waste 2 hours of operating time. If you have no issue destroying the cyberware in the process you can reach for your machete and have that Cyberarm in your pack in a minute. Just remember, it will have to be repaired before it's of any use. While the installation of any cyberware you purchase is part of its cost, there are many reasons why you may still want to do your own installation surgeries off the grid, namely privacy. Your patient still suffers Humanity Loss from your installation, as normal. You can't do installation surgery on yourself unless the cyberware's typical installation is Mall.

The art of Bodysculpting has undergone a renaissance of sorts in the Time of The Red, as the low cost of vat grown clone tissue has made Bodysculpting financially attainable for segments of the population for whom it was previously out of reach. Accessibility has led to innovation in the practice: skin cancer is now no longer an issue, and Humanity Loss from most Biosculpting has been rePLacemenT ParTs When a Character loses a body part due to a Critical Injury such as Lost Eye or Dismembered Arm, they have a few options if they want to replace the missing meat. Standard Treatment practices at most hospi- tals involve using either a replacement cloned from the patient's own tissue and force grown to full size or a piece of med- ical-grade cyberware. Medical-grade cyberware replaces the lost body part with a piece of technology that offers no additional benefits beyond full func- tionality. Medical-grade cyberware does not have option slots for upgrades (such as Rippers or Chyron) and they don't count as cyberware for the pur- poses of causing damage. They also do not cause Humanity Loss. If a patient wants a full cybernetic replacement, they need to first pay for Treatment to repair the Critical Injury and then pay the cost of the cyberware. If Nightingale loses her arm in a fight and wants a cyberarm she can upgrade later, for example, she has to pay 1,000eb for the Treatment and 500eb for the arm. 227 TRAUMA TEAM eliminated with the introduction of more life-like tissues. With the cost of materials being so low, street level providers like the Bodyshoppe and Doc's R Us™ have more freely experimented with what is possible with Bodysculpting, competing to seasonally re-invent the landscape. It is no longer possible to identify a Bodysculpted human from a \"natural\" one by sight alone. It is much easier to assume that the most attractive person in a room is probably Bodysculpted. Exotic Bodysculpting, truly fantastic Bodysculpt jobs that emphasize alien or inhuman features, like whiskers, muzzles, manes, reptilian skin, fur, tails, hooves, antennae, claws, fins, and paws have also become cheaper and more available. Exotic Bodysculpting, however, causes Humanity Loss due to its extreme effects, and represents a fringe practice in society, being the provenance of animal motif gangs, and other close-knit enthusiast groups. \"Exotics,\" people who get Exotic Bodysculpt jobs, typically also get cyberware to augment their abilities to bring them in line with their new form. A skilled Medtech can perform Bodysculpting surgeries on their own. These procedures take 4 hours, and if failed, destroy the materials required for the surgery and waste 2 hours of operating time. Street Drugs Drugs are dangerous and messing with them will probably mess up your Character for the long term. When you take street drugs, you typically are doing so using an Action with an Airhypo to administer a single dose of a desired drug to a willing target, or trying to make a single Melee Weapon Attack with an Action to administer a single dose to an unwilling target on a hit instead of dealing damage. When you are dosed with one of these drugs, you are automatically affected by the drug's Primary Effect. When the Primary Effect of the drug wears off at the end of its duration, you roll WILL + Resist Torture/ Drugs + 1d10 against the DV of the drug's Secondary Effect, which are permanent and habit forming until you receive therapy for addiction. Taking multiple doses of a drug extends the primary effect of a drug by its full duration. ▶ blACk lACe Cost per Dose: 50eb (Costly) Primary Effect • Lasts 24 Hours. • User takes 2d6 Humanity Loss upon taking a dose, which is returned if the user isn't affected by Black Lace's Secondary Effect. • For the duration of the Primary Effect, the user ignores the effects of the Seriously Wounded Wound State.

T herapy and YOU! Empathy is a STAT, and for each point of EMP you have, you have 10 points of Humanity. A Character that starts with 5 EMP has 50 Humanity, for example. As you undergo Humanity Loss (mainly through install- ing cybernetics), you'll lose points of Humanity. Every time you lose enough Humanity that the ten's place on your Humanity changes, like going from 50 Humanity to 46 Humanity, your EMP is effectively lowered to the ten's place of your Humanity, in this case, EMP 5 to EMP 4. That's where Therapy comes in. When you want to keep all your Cybernetics without feeling less empathetic, or when you want to kick an addiction. It's certainly not cheap, or easy, but it is quite fast when compared to similar treatments from yesteryear. Most of the improvements in the effi- ciency of these therapies are due to pharmaceuticals pioneered by Biotechnica during the 4th Corporate War. A skilled Medtech can perform therapies on their own, using the Medical Tech Skill granted to them through their Role Ability, Medicine. Each of these therapies takes 1 entire week, during which the doctor and their patient can do nothing else. At the end of the week, the doctor rolls against the DV of the Therapy. On a success, the patient gains the Effect of the Therapy. On a failed Check, the entire week was for nothing, and any materi- als used were lost. The materials used for these Therapies are controlled entirely by Biotechnica, and they must be purchased directly from the company. The price listed for Therapy assumes the patient is not sleeping in the hospital overnight during the Therapy process. If they are, they must pay 100eb per night, as standard.

DV17 Materials are 500eb (Expensive) C yberpsychosis Humanity Loss is defined (for this purpose) as a loss of empathy for others and a corresponding loss of self-regard or sense of self preservation. Subjects with low Humanity have trouble emphasizing with themselves or others as \"real.\" Instead, they start to see themselves or others as collections of parts instead of living, breathing organisms. This is basically a form of dissociative disorder. According to the Mayo Clinic: Dissociation is a mental process of disconnecting from one's thoughts, feelings, memories, or sense of identity. The dissociation disorders that need professional treatment include dissociative amnesia, dissociative fugue, depersonalization disorder, and dissociative identity disorder. Traumatic events that occur during adulthood may also cause dissociative disorders. Such events may include war, torture, or living through a natural disaster. DePeRsonAliZAtion DisoRDeR Depersonalization disorder is characterized by feeling detached from one's life, thoughts, and feelings. People with this type of disorder say they feel distant and emotionally unconnected to themselves, as if they are watching a character in a boring movie. Other typical symptoms include problems with concentration and memory. The person may report feeling ‘spacey' or out of control. Time may slow down. They may perceive their body to be a different shape or size than usual; in severe cases, they cannot recognize themselves in a mirror. 231 TRAUMA TEAM how CybeRwARe Fits in Developing cyberpsychosis is not triggered merely by putting in cyberware. It is in the voluntary removal of a functioning body part to replace it with a machine. It is generally not normal to voluntarily cut off a limb or remove a functioning body part. Putting in an earring involves some self-harm, but on a level that is barely discernible to the person doing it. It also does not require the removal of a body part. However, voluntarily choos- ing to replace a working part for no other reason than aesthetic or functional advantage requires that the user already be able to get past the qualms of cutting up one's body voluntarily. Cyberpsychosis comes about when the subject begins to compulsively alter the body beyond the human baseline. Seeing the body as a thing—a form of Dissociative Personality Disorder—they change it without thought. Why this doesn't count for people who have non-voluntarily needed cyberware: Replacing a lost or damaged body part with a new cloned part or Medical-Grade Cyberware (only 50eb to purchase separately, cost is included in the cost of a hospital visit in the rare circumstance when a cloned limb isn't available) will not increase disso- ciation. This is because the replacement of the body part makes the person feel \"whole\" again, increasing their level of body awareness. Now, if they replaced that limb with a cyberarm with knives in the knuckles—that choice was voluntary because it was excessive augmentation, and will thus come with Humanity Loss. mentAl tRAumA Adding cyberware is not the only thing that can cause Humanity Loss. Humanity Loss also occurs when the subject experiences strong and traumatic events, such as torture or living through a natural disaster. And unfortunately, Edgerunners deal with these sorts of situations on a regular basis. This is something your GM controls; they often times may attach Humanity Loss on an event or situation (like when you stumble across a pack of scavvers eating a baby). Type of Trauma Example of Trauma Humanity Loss Traumatic Physical Incident Torture 1d6 Traumatic Mental Incident Witnessing a particularly horrific death, mutilation, etc. 1d6 Long-term Mental Stress Kidnapping, imprisonment. Long term abuse. 2d6 Long-term Environmental Stress Factors Starvation or being trapped in a war zone, experiencing devastation from a long-term disaster, or living in constant danger for a month. 2d6 difficuLT subjecTs A big part of getting to know your Players is getting to know what they are and aren't comfortable with. Cyberpunk RED is a mature setting and often deals with uncomfortable topics. You can derail a game ver y quickly by invoking something that makes your Players uncomfortable, angry, or depressed, so it is a good idea to work out boundar- ies ahead of time. In tabletop gaming, there's a concept known as \"lines and veils\". Lines represent hard limits that a Player does not want to deal with when gaming. Veils represent the idea that something can be part of the story, but the Player would prefer it not be described and the scene \"fade to black\". Being aware of the lines and veils of the people you're gaming with can be a good skill to have. If, as a GM, you're unsure of how to talk to your Players about the topics they might have issues with, there are a number of free and well- made tools out there on the Internet that can help facilitate the conversation. 232 TRAUMA TEAM eFFeCts oF CybeRPsyChosis Cyberpsychosis is not necessarily always violent. Not all \"cyberpsychos\" are violent. However, a number of cases, particularly those who have already mani- fested psycho-pathological or sociopathic tendencies, will find those tendencies magnified to a dangerous extent. Specifically, their view of others as things to be used or harmed without thought or empathy increases dramatically. From the Hare Psychopathy checklist, ele- ments of psychopathy include: • Grandiose sense of self • Need for stimulation • Cunning and manipulative • Lack of remorse or guilt • Callousness and lack of empathy • Poor behavioral controls • Impulsivity • Failure to accept responsibility • Criminal versatility This game assumes that if you already have a low EMP, you will be more prone to these symptoms and that the act of cramming unneeded cyberware into your body may trigger this reaction. Dissociation + Psychopathic Tendencies = Cyberpsychosis or, put another way... \"I'm a thing.\" + \"Everyone else is a thing.\" = \"Why not just kill anything that gets in my way?\" So outside of a game mechanic, this works out to be: • You already have low Empathy. Which means you are already prone to dissociative mental problems. • You also have an underlying issue with psy- cho-pathological/schizophrenic illnesses (low EMP to begin with). • Easily replacing body parts for no therapeutic reason enhances dissociation. So does external and psychological trauma. • The greater the dissociation, the more likely psycho-pathological symptoms will emerge on top of the disassociation. • When angered, irritated or just looking for stimulation, you lash out in rage or just for \"fun.\" the Rules oF CybeRPsyChosis If your Empathy is... ▶ 3 oR GReAteR No cyberpsychosis or dissociative disorder. ▶ equAl to 2 Borderline dissociative disorder.

Capture and rehabilitation are rare. 233 BY NEIL BRANQUINHO welcome to welcome to the dark futurethe dark future Pay attention, punks.

Trace Santiago 234 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE how did it get So bad? T he Fall OF America By the end of the 1980s, it was evident that the United States was in trouble. Most social norms had dissolved under an all-engulfing wave of competing special interest groups, media-fueled fads, and an overall \"me first\" worldview. By 1994, the number of homeless on the streets had skyrocketed to 21 million. The technical revolution had further torn the economy apart, creating two radically divergent classes—a wealthy, technically oriented, materially acquisitive group of Corporate profession- als; and a down-class of homeless, unskilled, blue-col- lar workers. The middle class was nearly eradicated. It was this dismal beginning that led to the American landscape of the 2000s. Here are just a few of the major trends leading to the collapse of the American Nation. uRbAn CollAPse In large cities, business areas were clean, neat, well- lit showcases, free of crime and poverty, controlled by powerful Corporations. Ringing the central areas were the Combat Zones—decrepit, squalid suburbs, and burned-out ghettos teeming with boostergangs and other violent sociopaths. The outer suburbs were also Corporate-controlled zones; safe, well-guarded tracts where executives raised their families in relative security. CoRRuPt AnD ineFFeCtive GoveRnment Under the corrupt rule of the Gang of Four (a cabal of four government agencies: the NSA, the CIA, the DEA, and the FBI, all led by the brilliant and psychopathic Vice President), American government descended into the realm of mobster rule. Ruthlessly pursuing its agenda of illicit profit above all, the Gang hollowed out Social Security and Medicare, eliminated Welfare (unless tied to one of their Corporate clients) and plundered the resources of the United States like a giant personal piggybank. The only untouched area of the government was the military, which the Gang lavished money upon to maintain service loyalty and to finance the Gang's expansive policy of war-based imperialism. By the time the Gang was ousted, the U.S. Senate was no longer functional (having been suborned or intimidated by the Gang over years), the Supreme Court was no longer the law of the land for the increasing number of self-declared \"Free States,\" and most of the federal bureaucracy was in shambles, leaving the country unable to cope with the waves of crises devastating the population. the Rise oF the FRee stAtes Individual states, fed up with the ineffectual and dicta- torial actions of the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C. (and the recently exposed machinations of the Gang of Four), began to break away from the main body of the country; first California, north and later south, then Texas, Oregon, Washington and the Dakotas. These new \"Free States\" set their own laws (although most were remarkably similar), trade arrangements, and most importantly, no longer sent their collected taxes back to Washington, D.C. This only hurried the collapse of the unified nation. the new Rustbowl Unprepared to deal with the effects of worldwide global warming, vast areas of the northern hemi- sphere began to suffer unending years of back-to- back drought. Throughout the Midwestern states, many small towns were abandoned, as local farms, businesses, and banks collapsed in the wake of this drought, famine, and economic chaos. What farms that survived were eventually bought up by huge Agricorporations, and were maintained with Corporate-controlled wells, hired workers, machine labor, and well-equipped guards. Midwest urban zones also suffered during this time; not from drought, but a collapse of manufacturing jobs and industries fleeing the country for cheaper labor in Asia and Africa. Unchecked Corporate mergers and acquisitions destabilized entire areas of production, especially as well-heeled investors bought successful companies, then pillaged their assets and sold the dried husks at pennies on the dollar to finance their debts. 235 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE But the hollowing out of the center of the country had an unexpected series of costs; millions became homeless, and were forced to travel the open roads to seek shelter in the urban zones in a latter-day version of the Dust Bowl period of the American 1930s. The open freeways soon became battlegrounds, as armed packs of booster gangs also traveled from city to city, looting and pillaging the homeless travelers like mech- anized Visigoths. the PlAGues An already overtaxed medical system found itself inundated by a series of plagues that swept the planet. Aided by easy and rapid transportation between countries, densely packed urban zones, and a willful tendency for the broken governments of the period to ignore or downplay the effects of medical emergencies, the \"hot zones\" spread like fusion-fed explosions, devastating entire continents. For example, the Wasting Plague of 1999, a horrible infection that attacked the intestines of its victims and made them starve to death no matter how much food they ate, tore across Europe and landed in the United States, where, ignored in the chaos of the Gang of Four's rule, it killed an estimated 14 million people before a vaccine was finally developed in Japan. The Wasting Plague was only one of a series of epidemiological disasters that hammered the planet, some natural, some bioengineered as part of various national pro- grams. Each one was just another nail in the coffin of a society already out of control. the Rise oF CybeRnetiCs Humanity has always pushed back against its limits. Poor eyesight? Get glasses. Hearing failing or poor? Get a cochlear implant. Hip going out? Replace it with a steel one. But by the late 20th century, the explosive levels of achievements in cybernetics (from cyber = machine + netics = control) opened up a new world of human potential. Now, it became: Poor eyesight? Replace those meat eyes with cyberoptics that can see for miles, in the dark, and maybe even shoot lasers like a superhero. Hearing failing or poor? Time to level up to an enhanced audio suite that can hear sounds that only dogs—or whales—can hear. Hip going out? Replace your entire skeleton with unbreakable, never-wearing-out steel. It's a new age, and you can become part of it by endlessly improving yourself. But this brave new world backfired. Corporations and governments began to employ cybernetically enhanced warriors to patrol the streets and fight their wars. People with cybernetic enhancements found themselves becoming impatient with the unenhanced and their (to the cybered-up) painfully slow pace. Cybernetic speed also allowed the rate of change— or engagement with the rush of a shifting world of endless information—to move still faster, leading to greater levels of technoshock (below) in society. People began to show signs of psychotic breaks, even- tually culminating in a plague of cybernetically driven, murderous rampages called cyberpsychosis. And so, one more log was added to the inferno consuming society at the end of the 20th century. enDless wAR With the option to deploy cybernetically boosted super-soldiers and an unlimited military budget, the Gang of Four was able to prosecute a series of foreign wars to start its new era of imperialism. But even with these advantages, the United States found itself dragged into a series of military quagmires with echoes of the Soviets in Afghanistan and the Old U.S. in Vietnam. This became even worse as the targeted nations began to use terrorist strikes (such as a pocket nuke in New York) to hit back at the Gang. By the time the Cyber Soldier Ten Thousand fought its way back from the SouthAm hellhole, the citizens of the United States were exceptionally tired of the endless battles filling their nightly news. AnD FinAlly, teChnoshoCk When technological change outstrips people's ability to comprehend or fit it into their lives, it creates tech- noshock, one of the major contributors to the social chaos that brought about the Collapse of the pre-Cy- berpunk world. Technoshock always starts small. A useful gadget or tool here. A new and very directed communications method there. Information systems that allow governments and Megacorps to watch and track you with surveillance or targeted advertis- ing that delivers what you want when you don't even know you want it...for your own good. Machines that adjust your sense of time and place to fit their needs. And all of it happening faster and faster, so that your mind is unable to process the changes and how it's BY NEIL BRANQUINHO 236 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE affected. The younger you are, the easier it is for you to deal with the accelerating change; you're used to it because you were born to it. But sooner or later, even the kids can't keep up. Suddenly, people freak out. They get irrational, violent. Families shatter; rela- tionships tear apart. People feel helpless in the face of the Universe. Eventually, the whole society grinds to a halt, the victim of a mass psychosis. The vast majority of people, their lives uprooted and changed by the advancements, sat passively waiting for their leaders to tell them what to do next. Megacorporations provided a neo-feudal alternative to the new and incomprehensible reality. One smaller group tried to turn back the pace, by founding the anti-technolog- ical Neo–Luddite movement. Still others decided to immerse themselves in the technological change. They coped by adding machines to themselves, enhancing their abilities and perceptions to allow themselves to catch up to the dizzying pace of the New. And earned themselves the nickname of \"Edgerunners\" or \"Cyberpunks.\" D ARK FUTURE COUNTDOWN a timeline for the dark future 1990 to 2045 1990 to 1993 • A secret ‘coup' launched by The Gang of Four, a coalition of government agencies led by the current Vice President, effectively ends federal democracy in the U.S. Many states begin ignor- ing federal authority, declaring themselves \"Free States.\" • Start of First Central American Conflict.

An incursion team led by Solo Morgan Blackhand and Rockerboy Johnny Silverhand attempt to steal/destroy the Arasaka Secure Database in the Arasaka Towers facility. During the assault, an area denial nuclear device is detonated, which destroys most of central Night City. Over half a million people are killed, and another quarter million die in the resulting aftermath. Militech is nationalized by U.S. President Elizabeth Kress by the expedient of reactivating Militech CEO Gen. Donald Lundee's reserve commission. • Beginning of the Time of the Red. Atmospheric particles from the nuclear blast in Night City, as well as debris from orbital rock strikes, conventional explosives, and the wartime burning and annihilation of cities and agricultural areas creates an eerie red pall over skies world- wide. For nearly two years, skies are tinged with a bloody red color, which eventually dies down to brilliant red sunrises and sunsets throughout the next decade. 2025 • End of the 4th Corp War. This includes a three-year wrap-up as pockets of fighting are quelled by Militech and national armies. While there is only one nuke dropped during the war, the world's infrastructure is severely impacted, although not destroyed. • NET is officially down. Alt Cunningham estab- lishes the Ghost World in the ruins of a bio-de- stroyed city. • Japanese government almost breaks down. By repudiating Arasaka, national face is saved.

Groups displaced from wrecked cities now set out to Reclaim nearby cities abandoned since the Collapse of the 1990s. They are supported by Nomads who set up convoys between cities. • There is massive looting of old tech and aban- doned storehouses. Only scattered Corps are still functioning and only on a very reduced basis, Local businesses are left to take up the slack, often with resources plundered from abandoned Megacorp facilities. • Very limited VPNs within Corporate parks. AIs occasionally creep into the wrecked cities' old NETs to seek out other AIs to join the Ghost World. • Arasaka breaks into three warring factions: the Kiji 雉 (Green Pheasant) Faction, headed by Hanako Arasaka; The Hato 鳩 (Dove) Faction, helmed by supporters of Michiko Arasaka, Kei's youngest daughter, who as a U.S. citizen, instead allies with the new U.S. government; and the Taka 鷹 (Hawk) Faction, led by Saburo's rebel son Yorinobu. • The remaining United States is now a functional dictatorship under President Elizabeth Kress' State of Emergency. Eager to find out about the world during the Time of the Red? Skip to page 257. 241 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE 2030 to 2035 • Resettlement of Suburban Night City. In time, Night City Central will be rebuilt, but for now, the foothills and the small cities around Night City are overpacked with refugees fleeing the radioactive ruins of the Corporate Zone. • Reestablishing of Nomad High Roads. Nomads now operate ports, container ships. Corporations are now mostly local, but as Nomads establish trade routes, Corps branch out regionally. • Start of CitiNets, local VPNs established in some of the Reclaimed Cities. These networks are usually \"air gapped\" with only limited (and strongly controlled) access between them. Netwatch oversees the development of this new series of networks, with Corporate backing. • Like Elvis sightings, rumors arise that Rockerboy Johnny Silverhand's body has been kept in cold storage in a body bank in the wreckage of Old Night City. Although this is never substantiated, the claim is that it has been stored there by a full- body conversion (FBC) fan of his who recovered it from the Arasaka blast site. • Start of Night City Reconstruction. Gigatons of fill are shifted from the radioactive ruins of the central City. Much of the old Bay is filled in. 2035 to 2045 • First Wave Cities start Reclamation under support from local governments and remaining Megacorps. These First Wave Cities are ones that require only a limited amount of resources to rebuild. • \"We have no United States until we have a country again.\" – Pres. Elizabeth Kress. While local Elections resume, there will be no national elections until a treaty exists between Free States and remaining United States. • Rebuilding of old factories by Corporations and other individuals begins to replace lost tech. New Corps start to rise from the wreckage of the 4th Corp War. • Rumors spread that legendary Solo Morgan Blackhand has been spotted in various First Wave cities. • Netwatch attempts to clear out the R.A.B.I.D.S. and reestablish the Old NET. After a losing three- year battle, they give up and shut down all the major Nodes into the Old NET (although some Netrunners still try to go there to loot the aban- doned systems). • Establishment of first Data Pools, information servers and exchange systems designed for open use within the limits of a city. Data Pools produce free, open content created through the collabo- rative efforts of a community of users. In design, they're similar to the hyper-stack \"page\" system attempted and then abandoned for the NET in the early 90s. • Rise of the first Mega Buildings to handle home- less population. These are \"all-in-one\" arcologies designed to rapidly create safe, habitable zones. • Beginning of first new factories replacing, upgrad- ing, or repairing old and scattered tech. 2045 • The Present. yuh, the time oF the ReD is yuh, the time oF the ReD is Almost Almost bibliCalbibliCal sometimes. sometimes.

Although some nations of the Euro-bloc (Greece, parts of Central Europe, and Britain) lagged behind the most success- ful nations (Germany, France, Italy, the Scandinavian countries), the nations of the Continent were uniformly stable, relatively prosperous, and Corporate-run. Some inequity was present, but in the day-to-day, unlike their American counterparts, a European citizen could depend on regular meals, clean air and water, and a regular (if not boring) job to go to. There was a roof overhead and crime was kept to a minimum. In some ways, Unified Europe was like a Corporate Beaverville; safe, controlled by the Corps, and a little boring until you got to where the rich and powerful dwelt. RussiAn RevAnChment Russian politics of the early 2000s was dominated by the Novosovetskaya partiya (or New-Soviet Party (NSP) after the 1999 general election over- threw the incompetent Russian Federation estab- lished under Gorborev. The NSP has been the only ruling party to control the government since then. Sovietized economic and social reforms dominated the majority of the population, under the directives of the Tsentral'nyy Organ (Central Authority), a 243 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE rotating council of kleptocrats who controlled the major \"state\" industries. The Media Lyle Thompson once described the NSP as a \"capitalist-crony kleptocracy with the nice shiny democratic cover removed.\" AsiA AsCenDAnt While the rest of the world struggled through the ravages of the late 20th century, the nations of Asia were well-prepared for the vicissitudes of climate change and environmental degradation. China, Japan, and Korea rapidly concluded that coal burning and oil were too costly to continue basing their expansion on, and instead shifted to creat- ing vast fields of oceanic algae that were easily converted to the CHOOH2 processes of the United States. This quantum shift also provided more food for the Asian nations' dense populations, although strong (some say draconian) birth control programs in some nations also helped reduce excess pop- ulations. Crowded and teeming with people, the cities of Japan, China, Korea, and the Philippines still managed to sustain high levels of food security, safety, and comfort even if many lack personal free- doms common in other nations. miDeAst meltDown The Meltdown of the '90s left vast areas of Iran, Libya, Iraq, Chad, and the Arab Emirates as radioactive fields of glass. Only Egypt, Syria, and Israel survived intact. During the 2020s, only scavengers and the desperate entered the hot zones to hunt for hardware and valuables among the glowing ruins. AFRoFutuRism AnD the hiGh FRontieR Once a fractured continent of feuding countries under a bewildering array of dictators, democracies and socialist states, the new and united Africa was re-born as the many nations of Central Africa banded together to negotiate with the Euronations who sought to build the Kilimanjaro mass driver. As the prominence of the Central African states grew other nations across the continent joined this Pan-African Alliance. The Pan-African Alliance established the strongest of all the footholds in space—nearly one-third of all space construction workers were African, and the majority of spaceport facilities and construction areas were built on African soil. The resulting population evolved into a \"national\" group called the Highriders; a space-based, high-tech society, linked by Pan- African roots and a determination never to be victims of colonial oppression again. CentRAl AnD south AmeRiCA After several lengthy wars with the United States, Central America emerged as a strong union of independent states, working under a pact of mutual cooperation. The U.S. was expelled from all but the Panama Canal Zone (which it still holds by sheer military force against ongoing guerrilla aggression). In South America, Argentina, Chile, and Brazil rose to become the defacto leaders of the Organization of American States, having thrown the U.S. out after their actions in the SouthAm Wars. The OAS, maintained its place as a major world power, on the level European Union.BY ADRIAN MARC 244 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE A merica: The Eagle Falls a global fireStorm During the last years of the 20th century, a series of ecological disasters also took a huge toll on the infrastructure of the United States. Global warming melted much of the polar icecaps, resulting in higher sea levels. Large parts of the East Coast and the South went underwater or partially became swampland; what remained of New Orleans ended up on stilts and Houston rapidly found itself with a much increased local alligator population. Rising temperatures thawed out much of southern Alaska, northern Canada, and the upper U.S.; these became the new breadbasket areas, producing the verdant fields of bio-engineered \"survival grains\" that became the basis of much of the U.S. economy. However, these same changes in climate dried up even more areas than they helped. In the Great Plains and Southwest, whole regions became desert in only a few years; unhampered by tree cover, violent winds scoured the land with driving sandstorms. The Pacific Northwest suffered through twenty years of drought-stricken forests and water shortages. This in turn triggered immense forest fires that roared through the tinder-dry forests, covering the entire West in a pall of thick, grey smoke. Dustbowl hell From Seattle to San Francisco and San Diego, the main issue became water: how much, who owned it, and where to get more. In Los Angeles, shifting ocean currents diverted rainfall from the central coast; the result was dense ground fogs mixing with smog to create an acidic, poisonous soup over the LA basin. Only sixty miles away, that same shifting current left San Diego a desert city. Night City, straddling the area between NorCal and SoCal, was left with a mix of everything; sweltering dry summers and cool, dry winters, punctuated by peri- odic acid rainstorms and choking poison ground smog. Things were even worse further east, as rain no longer reached the inland areas of the Great Plains. These areas, save for those maintained by Petrochem for its vast fields of modified corn and wheat for CHOOH2 processing, turned into barren dust bowls rivaling those of the late 1930s. muCk, miRe, AnD DeAD seA Zones Sloppy pollution controls in the latter half of the 20th century left permanent environmental scars on America. Massive acid-rain storm fronts battered the Midwest, poisoning drinking water and crops. Two entire regions of the Eastern seaboard were reduced to wasteland as power companies abandoned nuclear reactors during the Collapse and let their contents leak into the water table. Abortive \"rock strikes'' from lunar-based mass drivers during the first Orbital War obliterated Tampa and Colorado Springs; the explosive impacts blasted millions of tons of dust and heat into the atmosphere to further aggravate global warming. Toxic spills on both coasts, the dumping of medical wastes from years of the Wasting Plague, all of these have contributed to a steep die-off of ocean life, including marine mammals, food fish, and the phytoplankton necessary to replenish Earth's oxygen supply. the wAstinG PlAGue Plagues decimated large sections of the population as the AIDS epidemic of the 1990s escalated into the AIDS II crisis of the early 2000s. Stalling by poli- ticians and academic infighting among researchers delayed a cure so long that in the intervening years, the disease mutated to a more virulent form. Even worse, the Wasting Plague of 1999 further tore through the population, killing hundreds of thousands over the course of only a few years, followed only a decade later by the short-lived Carbon Plague of 2020, which targeted adults but left many younger people alive and orphaned. l.A. shAkeDown To cap off several decades of ecological and socie- tal disaster, in late 1999 a 10.5 quake shattered Los Angeles, and the Pacific Ocean rushed in to inundate 35% of the city. An estimated 65,000 were killed. But there was more to come. T he Gang of Four In the latter half of the 20th century, the United States faced a wide variety of external and internal threats. With things rapidly being overwhelmed in the chaos, the time became right for a coalition of government 245 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE agencies, later tagged by investigative Media Tesla Johanneson, as \"The Gang of Four,\" to launch a secret coup within the United States government, effectively ending federal democracy in the U.S. As later revealed by Johanneson, the cabal was made up of the heads of four agencies and the Executive Branch as led by the Vice President. exeCutive bRAnCh James Richard Allen, President of the United States: They say the fish rots from the head. But in this case, it was more that the head was detached from the rest of the fish long before it started to rot. The President of the United States during the earli- est Gang of Four years was a generally amiable, regular guy; just not terribly bright. He was easily manipulated by his Vice President and his National Security Council, which were making money through war profiteering and overthrowing selected South American governments. Harold Harrison Hunt, Vice President of the United States: A venial psychopath with a severe lack of any scruples, \"H.H.\" Hunt was favored by a wealthy family empire, as well as possessing an extremely charming and good-looking demeanor. He'd already managed to parlay this into a series of corrupt business deals throughout the world, amassing sizable fortunes in real estate, media, and Corporate stock. When several of his European partners began to chafe under his leadership, Hunt decided to shift gears and just take over the U.S. instead. nAtionAl seCuRity CounCil The Vice President conspired with the NSA to over- throw several countries in SouthAm with the goal of expanding U.S. influence and taking control of food and raw materials (for their Corporate clients). The Gang brought the Attorney General into the cabal to provide the justification for their destabili- zations, accusing the targeted nations of supporting drug smugglers (thus involving the DEA) and external criminal/terrorist organizations (bringing in the FBI). The CIA was later brought into the plot to provide intel and black ops resources in exchange for a cut of the take. CentRAl intelliGenCe AGenCy Brought into the plot by the NSA, the CIA's primary concern was the growing independence of the South and Central American nations. As these nations began to carve out their own economic paths, they threatened the lucrative captive markets of several powerful U.S.-based Megacorps. In addition, the CIA had begun to employ rebel terrorist groups to destabilize hostile nations and keep \"socialist forces\" from gaining control. FeDeRAl buReAu oF investiGAtion Used by the Gang to find and prosecute \"enemies of the state,\" the FBI also provided wiretapping, intelligence on, and covert surveillance of targets throughout the U.S. Although only a minor part of the original Plot, the FBI became enmeshed in the wheels of the conspiracy as the Gang began to employ its own mercenary armies of \"federal agents\" to control the restive states. DRuG enFoRCement AGenCy Providing the excuse for the invasion of central and western South America (Bolivia, Chile), the DEA had long wanted to stem the tide of cocaine and other drugs moving north to their eagerly waiting audience of U.S. addicts. In addition, elements of the DEA wanted to gain the favor of a cabal of pharmaceutical Megacorps who wanted the SouthAm drug dealers out of the way so that they could flood the market with their own artificially-created superdrugs. A mysteRious mAlADy In early 1991, a powerful bio-agent swept the coca plantations of South America, turning the lush fields into brown and festering pulp. Simultaneously, a sus- piciously similar bio-agent swept through the poppy fields of Central Asia, wreaking havoc with the opium production of the region. Their economies practically wiped out, the drug lords of two continents set out to uncover who was responsible. As later revealed by investigative Media Tesla Johanneson, the Gang of Four was secretly responsible for releasing these bio-agents as part of a long-range plan to destabilize the governments of several key South 246 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE and Central American countries (as well as a significant portion of central Afghanistan) for their own gain. To complicate matters further, in late 1999, Johanneson discovered that the CIA had diverted a portion of the proceeds from illegal weapon sales to fund groups of SouthAm separatists attempting to overthrow the legal governments of Chile and Bolivia. This was supported by the Gang as both nations had massive reserves of lithium (Chile = 7.5 million tons, Bolivia = 9 million tons), a vital mineral used to produce electronics and of which the U.S. had a depleted supply. And while the economies of these drug-producing nations did rely heavily on drug income, their very sovereignty was now also under attack. But while the SouthAm nations had only their meager military forces to draw upon, such was not the case with the drug lords of the Afghanistan high- lands. Years of fighting the Soviets and other invaders had forced them to make deals with several powerful Europe-based political groups, who in turn had con- tacts throughout the halls of many major governments. It was never clearly determined who gave the orders, (and Tesla Johanneson was killed before he could find out who was backing the Afghans), but once the orig- inator of the bio-weapon was uncovered as the DEA, drug producers on both sides of the Atlantic struck back in coordinated raids against the U.S. stARteD, the DRuG wARs ARe Armed with a proper excuse, the Gang promptly sent units of the U.S. Army south to wipe out these \"scourges of the innocent,\" and \"incidentally\" conquer the ground they were standing on. In response to the U.S. interventions, the beleaguered SouthAm \"drug nations\" started a savage guerrilla war that rapidly escalated to Vietnam levels. The Afghan drug lords went untouched; the U.S. didn't really have the resources at the time to fight that war on two fronts, and the Neo-Sov's threat to get involved cooled their heels. At first, it looked like the U.S. Army would simply walk right over the SouthAm forces, much as they had decades ago in the Panama Canal Zone. But the SouthAm nations refused to stay put in their own countries, launching guerrilla attacks all over the continental U.S. and its satellite territories. Finally, in retaliation for U.S. attacks on Bogota, Colombian drug lords detonated a small \"suitcase\" nuclear device in the New York Financial District, killing 15,000. Ominously, the device seemed all too similar to devices employed by the Neo-Sovs years ago in their abortive and unsuccessful war against the Afghans. the CRAsh oF '94 As part of the Plan, the heads of the CIA had been covertly selling black market U.S. arms for money; first, to support the rebels under their control, but soon to finance speculative investments that would directly enrich the members of the cabal. Unable to go to Congress for support, they \"laundered\" the money through a series of holding companies buying stocks on the European and Asian Exchanges. This aroused the suspicions of the European Union, which after several years of careful investigation by Interpol (the EU's equivalent of the FBI) formally charged the government of the U.S. with stock manipulation and money laundering. This led to the World Stock Market Crash of ‘94, a worldwide financial meltdown result- ing from the news going public. DeAth oF A PResiDent While campaigning in California, then-President Richard Allen was assassinated by an unknown assailant. Some suspect the assassin was Corporate- funded and working in the interests of Vice President Hunt. Subsequently, Harold Harrison Hunt became President and had free reign to accelerate the plans of the Gang of Four. the CollAPse AnD mARtiAl lAw The subsequent U.S. Collapse decimated the U.S. economy, leaving millions homeless and the govern- ment outside of Washington D.C. in free fall. So, the U.S. military was pulled back to the U.S. to establish martial law and maintain order amid the chaos. As directed by the Gang, the military used savage and often inhumane tactics to restore order. In one infa- mous case, the Houston Incident, military forces under the direction of the Gang of Four killed over 2,000 people by artillery barrage when they refused to disband during a march on the city to demand housing and food. With a shoot-on-sight curfew established in As a result of the bio-weapon and the drug wars, most narcotics in 2045 are synthetic. 247 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE many U.S. cities like New York, Chicago, and San Francisco, the rule of the military proved to be harsh indeed. Federal forces, covertly taken from the ranks of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Immigration and Naturalization Services, the Federal Prisons system, and paramilitary mercenaries provided secretly by several large Megacorps, were also directed to the streets of cities all over the U.S. Usually unidentified by uniforms or badges, these irregulars only contrib- uted to the impression that the government forces had turned into a gang of thugs; the result was that local governments and their allies protested, then resisted the federal invasion with counterattacks that ended in pitched battles, with State militias and the National Guard units facing down the paramilitary troops. Much of this was interrupted by ongoing disasters happening all over the United States: The Collapse, the Nomad Riots (then known as the Homeless Riots), the Los Angeles Quake, and the first emergence of the Wasting Plague. But the seeds of rebellion had been planted and were ready to explode. the suCCession wARs A s states clashed w ith the gover nment in Washington D.C., they began to consider leaving the Union altogether. This began in states like New York and Texas as economic strikes, in which rebel states refused to send taxes to Washington. These escalated to economic blockades in which states stopped commerce from leaving or entering their borders as an action against the federal govern- ment in Washington D.C. This deadlock reached a head in 1993, when one of the Gang's extra-legal \"police forces\" brutally took control of San Francisco, leading to a pitched battle in the streets between residents and the paramilitar- ies. The governor of California called in the National Guard, who took the side of the city in the debacle. Paramilitaries operating under the aegis of the Feds next attempted to take the state capitol of Sacramento in response. This led in turn to the state proclaiming the current federal administration in Washington D.C. as null and void, and declaring the establishment of official articles of separation. The military, which already had come to regret supporting the actions of the Gang of Four, refused to become involved in the succession wars, even after Californian authorities dynamited the passes into the eastern part of the state from Nevada (Interstates 80 and 15) and Arizona (Interstates 10 and 40). At this point, several more states begin ignoring federal authority, declaring themselves \"Free States\" The military, looking at the Gang's orders to recon- quer the country, shrugged and said, \"Hey, Posse Comitatus, baby,\" and retreated to their bases in disgust. And so, the Free States stayed free. bACk to the southAm Desperate to regain the raw materials they had just lost to the seceding states, the Gang went back to the war drawing board. This time, they constructed a force that could fight in the jungles of the SouthAm, using recent breakthroughs in cybernetics and interface chips. The Army, fed up with fighting its own citizens and loathing the idea of having to re-establish martial law in the face of the Free States, was willing to sign up for another try at pacifying the SouthAm nations, lured by the promise of a way to test out their new \"cyber supersoldiers.\" So ten thousand troops, many of them \"cybered up\" to varying degrees, hit the ground in combat Aerodyne Vehicles (\"AVs\" in popular mil- speak) and entered a vicious ground war involving drug lords, Euro and Neo-Sov mercs, and angry locals who were just fed up with the \"gringos\" coming south to mess with them. At first, the new War went well, but as it continued to grind on like a revisited Vietnam, the remainder of the United States that had not declared itself part of the Free States began to loudly protest the idea of Washington D.C. pursuing a foreign war when so much of the country was hurting. In t he end , w hen W N S m e dia s tar Te s la Johanneson exposed secret NSA transcripts of the 1st Central American conflict, the fecal matter hit the turbine. Heavily armed mobs stormed the Capitol, supported by units of the military who had had enough and mercs from both U.S. and EuroTheatre Megacorps. The Gang of Four, exposed, fled. But they were hunted down, and in the end even President Hunt found himself run to ground at the 248 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE edge of the Florida swamps and set afire by a cheer- ing mob. The rest of the conspirators suffered similar or even worse fates. With the Gang of Four swept away on a wave of reform the question of presidential succession arose. With the Speaker of the House in the hospital and the three nearest in succession refusing the job, the position of President fell to Secretary of Defense, John Seward. As for the troops sent by the Gang to conquer the SouthAm; they faced the same fate as Xenophon's legendary Ten Thousand, far from home with no food, no nation, and no reliable allies. And like their histor- ical brethren, they too faced a long, long walk back through the hostile jungles and the northern deserts to a land that no longer cared about them. the CybeRPunk AGe beGins So, the Cyberwars were over, and America tried to heal itself. It wasn't all bad though. In the crammed megacities that were replacing the many, many small towns and suburbs that died in the Collapse, a fever- ish explosion of technological wonders and headlong capitalism created a glitzy, super-powered world dominated by huge Megacorporations that strode the world like nations. The Megas raised armies, fought for international domination, and shaped everything around them, while below the glittering towers of the ultra-rich seethed an ever-growing population of destitute, starving people scrambling just to survive. The only leveler was technology, as the masses trapped on the \"Street\" used cyberware, weapons, and raw cunning to beat their implacable Corporate foes. Whether they were called Edgerunners, Cyberpunks, or just plain rebels, they were the ones who stood up against the power of the Megacorps and fought to win against all odds. R ise of the Megacorps power vacuum As the millennium dawned, the state of the world was still rent by spasms of chaos. And as national gov- ernments lost their legitimacy (or control) it became inevitable that someone had to move into their places. And into this gaping hole of command and control stepped the most obvious (and organized) groups on the planet: the rising Megacorporations. For rapidly expanding, large scale companies with resources and operations all over the world, the logical step was that they should take over. After all, unstable governments are bad for business. For the first part of the 21st Centur y, the Megacorporations had been much like the interna- tional Corporations of the late 20th century, only much larger and more fully autonomous. They were very nearly nations in themselves, with their own laws, cities, factories, and armies. Most Corporations in the early 2000s were multinational, with branches and operations all over the world—some branches as small as a research facility or sales office, or some as large as a major manufacturing facility and security center. Most Megacorporations were manufacturers—they produced commodities for sale on the open market. Oil, steel, automobiles, aircraft, weapons, computers, cybernetics, bio-technologies—these were only a few of the literally millions of Corporate operations. Many Corporations had several commodities on the market; they controlled chemical plants in Europe, computer factories in Japan, and steel-making operations in the United States. Not all Megacorps were invested in manufacturing; Megacorps also controlled banking, food production, energy resources, and other key areas of society. One type of Corporation deserving special atten- tion were Mediacorps. These huge conglomerates grew out of a trend in the late 1980s, in which certain firms bought up TV networks, film companies, record companies, radio stations, and book, magazine, and even comic publishers, effectively centralizing the media under the control of a very few people. Under the Mediacorps, mass entertainment became generic and bland; dissenting opinions and independent productions were usually buried under an avalanche of media hype, or worse, co-opted or destroyed by vicious inter-Corp competition. Still worse was the effect on news and information as politicians realized that the right connection to the right Mediacorp could control the electorate—only a short step to being able to select, package, and sell their own versions of reality. The control exercised by the Mediacorp's thus was essential in establishing and legitimizing the role of the Megacorps in ruling the Post Collapse world. 249 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE meGACoRPs AnD GoveRnments Since the Crash of '94, the governments of the world had been in the uncomfortable position of having to let the multinational Corporations do pretty much as they pleased. Paying lip service to pollution control, product safety, and minimum wage rules, the multinationals easily dominated local governments through bribes and military support or trading power, influence, or money with the right leaders; a judge or police chief here, a senator or congressman there. Driven by greed, empowered by success, the Megacorps of the early 2000s dwarfed all but the most powerful nations, corrupting governments, reshaping policy, and even resorting to using private armies when economic clout wasn't enough. By the mid-2010s, the Megacorps pretty much ruled the world economy and much of the non-economic world as well; and most nations just shut up and collected what taxes they could extort from their over-sized business neighbors. That was until the Corporate Wars started to blow the whole cozy arrangement apart. when CoRPoRAtions Go to wAR The first Corporate Wars started as battles over turf or resources. However, as most Megacorps already had sizable security forces to defend their holdings in the wild and woolly world of the Post Collapse, it was inevitable that eventually one or more Megas started to use those physical forces to settle inter-corporate disputes when the lawyering became ineffective. ▶ The 1st Corp War ◀ auguSt 2004 to february 2006 The First Corporate War began simply enough: EBM's leveraged buyout of the failing Transworld Airlines turned unfriendly after their initial deal with Transworld's CEO went sour. Orbital Air, foaming at the mouth to obtain TWA's air-traffic facilities in the U.S., came to TWA's aid, blocking EBM's buyout attempt. EBM struck first, dispatching terrorists to kidnap the OA negotiations team en route to close the TWA deal. The terrorists bungled the job, and EBM's anonymity was compromised. Orbital Air immediately went to work, recruiting Zetatech as an ally, who unleashed a massive wave of NET attacks against EBM. These attacks, though damaging, were quickly put down, forcing Zetatech out of the war. EBM responded with a wave of attacks against TWA and OA facilities. Orbital Air met this challenge well, beefing up security and using their dominance in LEO to establish a blockade against EBM facilities. Orbital Air finally struck back with a wave of terror- ism and piracy of their own. EBM answered this threat with an army of Corporate Solos and proxy soldiers from developing nations. During this period, both companies changed allies as frequently as a joygirl changes partners. Hundreds of millions in Eurodollars were wasted, stolen, or simply destroyed as both firms attempted to cut each other's funding. In fact, at one point, both sides had to find financial supporters just to save their current allies from being wiped out. There were only two major battles during the con- flict. The first occurred when OA commandos captured a central EBM space station in response to a similarly large hijacking that same day by EBM. Both sides were chastised by the European Space Agency, who lifted all the blockades and warned the competitors not to extend their fight into LEO again. The second battle didn't occur until a year later, when OA com- mandos attacked CEO Ulf Grunwalder's compound in Bavaria, capturing him and forcing EBM to surrender. The ramifications of this war were vast. It was the first conflict of its kind. But more importantly, it gave other companies the green light to use wholesale military tactics to obtain favorable business results. Although some smaller firms had engaged in petty armed squabbles in the past, nothing had ever matched the ferocity and size of this conflict. And it seemed only a matter of time before another one would. ▶ The 2nd Corp War ◀ april 2008 to auguSt 2010 The Second Corporate War began as a misun- derstanding between the oil giants Petrochem and SovOil. Relations began to sour between the two firms when a merger deal fell through at the eleventh hour. A huge drilling rig accident at a Petrochem platform then brought the two companies to blows in a conflict the likes of which the Pacific Rim had not seen since World War Two. EBM: Euro Business Machines, a major player in computers and electronic hardware. OA: Orbital Air, the world's leading provider of air based transport. LEO: Low Earth Orbit. For more data on Petrochem see Page 275. For more data on SovOil see Page 277. 250 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE Initially, SovOil enjoyed a string of military victories, although both sides had severely crippled each other's oil facilities within a few weeks. Petrochem fought back hard, expending untold millions to regain the upper hand, at the cost of thousands of lives. Petrochem's success peaked with their surprise capture of the Spratly Island chain, and their assassination of SovOil founder and CEO Anatoly Novikovo. But it was still not enough. SovOil easily repelled Petrochem's follow-up offensive of October 2009, reduc- ing Petrochem's forces in the Pacific to impotency. There was no formal surrender, but the war effectively ended with SovOil victorious. The Second Corporate War had several ramifications. First, the war shocked the hell out of analysts and the public in general who believed that Corporate conflict could never elevate past the point the first war had reached. Second, this war marked the first time that a multinational firm actually publicly defied national governments. SovOil completely ignored international sanctions and did whatever it wished. Both sides used the smaller PacRim nations as extensions of their own armed forces, actively replacing administrations in some cases and installing friendlier ones. In fact, Petrochem's assas- sination of Novikovo was carried out with a squadron of modified Mirage 111 fighters on loan from Malaysia. Worst of all, because of constant raiding by both sides against each other's oil refin- eries, drilling facilities, and pipelines, the war left most of the southern Pacific Rim badly polluted. The South China Sea, the focus of the conflict, became a lifeless chemical stew, all but uninhabitable for several decades. Entire national economies were ruined, and although SovOil was forced to pay reparations, no amount of money would ever undo the damage. ▶ The 3rd Corp War ◀ february 2016 to november 2016 The Third Corporate War was another milestone in Corporate warfare because it was fought almost entirely in the NET. Almost. Hostilities began when financial examiners from the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce uncovered a confidence scheme being engi- neered by certain investment counselors at Merrill, Asukaga, and Finch against private investors, using the Rothstein Fund (a subsidiary of the Bank of New York) as leverage. They notified the District Attorney's office, which began an investigation the next day. The Rothstein Fund, angered by MA&F's duplicity, and not wishing to get dragged down in the investigation, turned everything they had over to the DA's office. They also hired local street Netrunners to begin probing MA&F's data fortresses in search of the truth. MA&F's administration took this move by their former ally as a direct attack. They immediately countered by stepping up NET security and unleashing their own Netrunners to launch an assault on the Rothstein Fund, first hitting Rothstein's financial clients. Then MA&F strike teams turned their attention to actively destroying Rothstein computer systems, which escalated the fighting still further. For several days, the situation was a confused melee. Data fortresses became armed camps as everyone nervously watched to see what would happen next. Netwatch responded by limiting NET access and cracking down on computer crime, making several sweeps resulting in numerous arrests and flatlines. why wars maKe cyberPunKs The Dark Future is a place rife with conflict and violence. But has it ever occurred to you to wonder how the people who live there are just so good at it? The answer is in the context. These are people who have been fighting on the mean streets since they were born. They are very much like child soldiers in real world conflicts. When you're good at fighting, it stands to reason that, when a chance to use those skills shows up, you're going to take that option. To you, a Corporate war or national conflict is just another place to collect a paycheck in the thing you do best—fight. Wars also give you access to the most cutting edge cyberware and enhance- ments. And even if you didn't choose a warrior path, chances are that at some time or other, you're going to be forced to pick up a gun and hit The Street. 251 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE When both the Rothstein Fund and MA&F decided to take their conflict to Meatspace, they began hiring mercenaries. During a 12-hour period, short pitched battles were fought in LEO and on Earth, all to destroy the physical locations of the enemy's NET communi- cations gear. These battles ended with considerable loss of life and millions in material destruction. The next six months consisted of endless NET raids, most of them inconsequential and indecisive. Indeed, more damage was done during the 12 hours of actual fire fights (that commo stuff is expensive) than during the entire remainder of the conflict. When it was over, the Rothstein Fund ceased to exist as single entity. MA&F turned the corpses of two of their executives who had started the whole mess over to the Los Angeles District Attorney's office. They also got stuck with the bill for damages done in Low Earth Orbit and on Earth. By this time, the idea of Corporate conflict shocked no one, although several analysts were surprised the war lasted as long as it did. That the conflict took place mostly in the NET was rather unusual, and it sparked a couple dozen theories by various pundits that perhaps this was the new way Corporate wars would now be fought. But still others maintained that, much like the infantry in military doctrine, Solos would never go out of style. T he 4th Corp War Like the first and second Corporate Wars, the 4th Corporate War began when rival Megacorps began to flex their military muscle to achieve a financial objective. In 2021, IHAG, a Megacorp specializing in underwater shipping and technology, went bankrupt, leading to two rival ocean-based Megacorps (CINO and OTEC) squaring off for a hostile takeover of IHAG's remaining assets. At first, both Corps engaged in the typical opening rounds of this kind of battle: stock manipulations and economic warfare, but as the conflict grew out of hand both companies began to engage in outright warfare. PhAse one: the ColD wAR The Cold War portion of the 4th Corp War (also known as the Ocean or Shadow War) was a par- ticularly vicious game of Corporate power politics playing out in a world without law. Starting with stock manipulation, minor facility sabotage and \"clean\" assassinations of key officers, CINO and OTEC soon reached the furthest extent of their own capabilities. Unable to gain an advantage, both Megacorps stepped up their tactics: each hired the forces of still larger Megacorps to provide troops and war-fighting material—in this case, OTEC hired Militech, a U.S.-based armaments and secu- rity force, and CINO hired Arasaka, a Japanese security Megacorp. As the two leading paramili- tary Corporations in the world, both Militech and Arasaka had been spoiling for a fight for most of the late teens and early 2020s, and the CINO-OTEC conflict provided the perfect excuse. And that's when the real war began. Arasaka and Militech had already been playing larger and larger roles during the course of the conflict. The percentage of \"security operatives\" on each side grew astronom- ically in the first three months, as did commitments of materiel and technology. In fact, the war between OTEC and ClNO gradually took a back seat to a contest of wills between the two largest private mil- itaries on the planet. Whatever resolution OTEC and ClNO managed to come to over IHAG rapidly became secondary; the juggernauts of Arasaka and Militech were already on a collision course. Soon, Arasaka and Militech began to move from minor incursions to extreme escalations of the typical tit-for-tat and Corporate espionage that they had been engaged in for years. As things heated up, the gloves came off and operations grew in frequency and lethality. Each side now cared less about covering its tracks and preventing bad publicity than it did about decimating its adversary. And when giants decide to play hardball in The Street, things always get very, very messy. PhAse two: the hot wAR As major international Megacorps at the absolute apex of Corporate power in the Cyberpunk age, both Arasaka and Militech were at a military scale equal to many of the smaller nations of WWII, fielding armies in the tens of thousands of troops. Both sides also possessed extremely advanced transportation and logistics systems, allowing them to strike at each other across the globe. For more data on Arasaka see Page 267 For more data on Militech see Page 272 252 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE This combination of sophisticated war-fighting tech- nology and lightning tactical movement made it all but impossible for many legitimate nations to stop these conflicts within their borders. Small engagements soon flared into major showdowns, until the battle reached a fever-pitch worldwide, with forces from both Megacorps staging major battles that embroiled entire cities. the lAnD wAR The 4th Corporate War changed not only the face of Corporate interaction and politics, but of warfare itself. Until now, wars were still fought much as they had been in the past, with battle lines, \"fronts,\" and clear-cut areas of conflict. It was easy to tell which side was winning and which was losing merely by looking at who had achieved which objectives. The Hot War was nothing like this. Attacks were sudden, savage, and usually unexpected. Targets could be anywhere on the globe, although most strikes were in mission-critical areas such as transportation, com- munications, and logistics. Attack forces were highly mobile with fast \"hit and fade\" tactics making it nearly impossible to stop and engage a force. AVs, panzers, and other highly mobile units made up the majority of the attacking forces, at least at the beginning. ACPAs and combat cyborgs were fielded for the first time in large numbers, with entire companies of them deployed on both sides. Battlefields were transformed into high-tech nightmares as remotes, battlefield robots, and infantry clashed for the first time. Even so, the War started out slow, as both sides tried to find out how much they could get away with without getting slapped down by the governments of the world. Probing raids were common, mostly targeted at the other side's military assets. As both sides grew more confident in their abilities (and in the realization that no one was going to rein them in) attacks became bolder and more brutal. By mid-year of the War, in parts of the developing world, set piece BY HÉLIO FRAZÃO 253 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE battles became commonplace. Airports, spaceports, factories, mines, even seaports and banking facilities became fair game as the stakes increased. By mid- 2022, pitched battles involving aircraft, AVs, tanks, power armors, and thousands of troops were the rule, as well as interdiction strikes on international trade, energy production, and transportation systems. As the war entered its fifth month, both sides began to show signs of exhaustion. Neither had planned for open warfare to last so long, and vital supplies like spare parts, weapons, ammunition, and medical supplies were becoming scarce. Vehicles, notably traditional \"hangar queens\" like AVs and panzers, started to show the stress of near continuous use without proper maintenance, as did ACPAs and cyborgs. Meat troops also suffered, as desertions and disciplinary problems became increasingly common, especially among hired mercenaries and independent contractors. Despite this multi-faceted fatigue, some Arasaka and Militech units still continued fighting (without support from either side) well into 2023 before exhausting themselves. the seA wAR One of the biggest effects of unrestricted Corporate warfare came about as both sides attempted to deny the other access to global shipping and transporta- tion. One method to accomplish this was to spread specially engineered bioplagues to target strategic seaport hubs, including Hong Kong, Shanghai, Busan, and Long Beach, all with wildly varied levels of success. Attempts were also made to target the crit- ical port of Singapore, but the Republic of Singapore Navy's (RSN) take-no-prisoner's approach made attacks by either Militech or Arasaka suicidal. With access to a relatively large number of sub- mersibles and small warships, both sides also waged an open war on shipping, especially on large container ships suspected of carrying muni- tions and supplies to the opposition (in one case of poor logistics and communications, both sides had loaded cargoes on the same ship, which the other sides' forces subsequently sank). In addition, both sides resorted to deploying autonomous weapons that wandered the sea lanes looking for potential targets, often sinking as many friendlies and neu- trals as they did enemies. The result was a total suspension of the world's trans- shipping trade, creating a worldwide economic crisis as hundreds of desperately needed container ships sat empty or abandoned by their crews mid-transit. Many of these ships are still drifting even into the Time of the Red, creating vast ghost fleets that are later scavenged or recovered by Nomads. The last effect of the sea war was almost tragicomic, as submarines and surface warships pounded the sea floor seeking their enemies' subsurface bases, resulting in the obliteration of almost all of the OTEC and CINO assets which had been the cause of the War in the first place. the oRbitAl wAR As Corporate attacks disrupted banking, informa- tion, and news services; orbital space narrowly escaped becoming another battlefield with subor- bital delta fighters and gunships, but at this point, the space-dwelling \"Highriders\" decided it was time to take a hand in the War. Up to now, Militech and Arasaka had held monop- olies on the ability to hit ground targets from orbit, known as Orbital Artillery (or ortillery). Orbital artillery can range from small \"crowbar penetration loads\" to multi-ton \"rocks\" fired by an ESA mass driver (little more than a normal reentry vehicle loaded with crushed lunar stone). The availability of ortillery made many of the attacks of The Hot War possible. An ortillery unit is almost immune to counter-battery fire, can be arranged long beforehand, and can be accurately targeted even into the middle of a city. Its kinetic energy and attack speed virtually ensure the destruction of its target and make engagement with any sort of active countermeasures difficult. The downsides of ortillery are the time it takes to arrive (usually around five minutes from the launch call), its signature (everyone knows you've started using ortillery once the first round arrives), and the fact that you have to have a launcher orbiting above you to use it (which may be hard to arrange). The other catch is that as soon as a launcher reveals itself, it's only a matter of time (ranging from minutes to a few days) before a rival orbital power destroys 254 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE or \"commandeers\" it. For all of that, ortillery strikes are nonetheless commonly used. And both sides had spent years placing dozens of launchers in orbit and spent considerable effort to place systems designed to take command of launchers belonging to other Corporations and governments. But it turned out they weren't the only ones. the seven-houR wAR The Highrider \"revolt\" that later became known as the Seven-Hour War was a decidedly well-organized and planned event: it soon became obvious in ret- rospect that the space-dwelling colonists had been preparing to break away from their ESA masters for some time, and the War only provided the excuse. A question that has plagued many post-War historians has been \"Where did the Highriders get the materiel, knowledge, and training to deploy such weapons?\" The short answer is no one really knows; but if you spend most of your time shuttling mass driven cargoes from Luna to orbit and back down to Earth, chances are that you will become pretty adept at calculating delta V and other components of ortillery; including the ability to make your own. If the alternative is to have your fragile life-supporting habitats blasted to shreds as sacrificial lambs in the middle of a raging space battle between Corporate forces, you learn really fast how to protect yourself. So before either side could move their war into space, the Highriders began to hit both sides with their own lethal suborbital \"ortillery\" strikes capable of wiping out most of a small city, as well as wiping out the Corporations' own orbiting satellites. When the dust settled, the Highriders announced that they would henceforth consider themselves an indepen- dent nation and neutral in the ground-side conflict. Or else. the net wAR As the ground, Sea, and Space Wars reached a fever pitch, the NET became its own tactical bat- tleground. During the Shadow War, Militech, con- cerned that Arasaka Netrunners and their Soulkiller programs would bury it, conducted a series of hits (some virtually headed up by Rache Bartmoss himself) to \"whittle down\" the Arasaka NET cadre. This strategy was more successful than Militech knew for a time. As a result, neither side retained the resources to conduct broad offensives in the NET (at least, not at first) and most NET combat was limited to localized battles around strike sites to deny the NET to the enemy. While even these small-scale NET attacks disrupted local business databases, the mass-attack Netruns or virus bombs many theorists feared didn't immediately materialize. Then it suddenly got worse. Seriously worse. the DAtAkRAsh It started out subtly, with only a few minor changes in databases, lost files, changed lines of machine code. But soon it exploded into wildfire, randomly shifting, erasing, or rewriting data, and destroying or altering everything it touched. \"It\" was the DataKrash, a deadly computer viral plague that literally tore the heart out of the worldwide information network. Created by brilliantly insane Netrunner and master hacker, Rache Bartmoss; overnight, the DataKrash invalidated the entire structure of information that made Megacorps and governments viable. With no way to keep secure records, no way to organize over long distances, no way to even track economies and money (the United States government went from solvent to bankrupt in a matter of minutes), the very foundations of the Information Age collapsed into the ruins of an already shattering world war. \"then the iGtAs (ihARA-GRubb \"then the iGtAs (ihARA-GRubb tRAnsFoRmAtion AlGoRithms) tRAnsFoRmAtion AlGoRithms) weRe weRe downloadeddownloaded, AnD AFteR , AnD AFteR About ten houRs, the net wAs About ten houRs, the net wAs Fully Fully transformedtransformed, AnD , AnD eveRyone sheePishly PluGGeD bACk eveRyone sheePishly PluGGeD bACk in. me, i Just stAyeD in. me, i Just stAyeD jaCked jaCked inin FoR the whole show. it wAs FoR the whole show. it wAs ReAlly inCReDible to wAtCh the ReAlly inCReDible to wAtCh the entiRe net Get entiRe net Get redesignedredesigned...\"...\" Rache BartmossRache Bartmoss bartmoss' guide to the net The IGTA standardized the NET so everyone experienced the same thing when in the same \"place\", among other functions. 255 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE What Rache Bartmoss didn't include in this little soliloquy is that he was doing more than just watching. Bartmoss was also working: infiltrating his DataKrash code right into the I-G Transformations that would run the NET, using a backdoor he'd set up months earlier on Manny Ihara's computer (knowing something of Ihara's proclivities, Bartmoss had made it look like a hentai anime porn file). In short, whereas most viruses must infect a computer system, the DataKrash was automatically loaded into every single computer that ever ran the NET. Period. The result is that there was never any chance to stop the \"spread\" of the DataKrash; it was as if every copy of Windows (an ancient and long obsolete operating system of the 1990s) had been coded with a virus built in. By the time Magnificent Curtis, head of the worldwide cyber- cop org known as Netwatch, realized the awful truth about the DataKrash it was too late: the process of the Krash was well underway; to stop it would have required stripping the operating system out of practi- cally every computer and cyberdeck on earth. And Rache Bartmoss was dead, killed by an assas- sination team early in the War, with an Arasaka-based \"ortillery\" strike totally obliterating the conapt block in which he lived moments afterward. At first, Netwatch was able to monitor and repair the damage as it occurred. But as the chaos mounted, Netwatch's leader and top Netrunner, Magnificent Curtis, realized that the crafty Bartmoss had out- gamed everyone. There was no way to get rid of the DataKrash virus without literally re-writing the entire structure of the NET itself. To make the disaster even worse, the nature of the DataKrash also allowed both computer-generated Artificial Intelligences (AI) and Soulkilled Pseudo Intellects (SPI) to travel through what remained of the NET unimpeded (possibly a favor from Bartmoss to his old friend and fellow program- mer, Alt Cunningham). Even more disastrous, Bartmoss left yet another surprise lurking in the bowels of the NET: a self-repli- cating virus that strongly resembled himself, based on a twisted version of the Soulkiller program, and later dubbed R.A.B.I.D.s (Roving Autonomous Bartmoss Interface Drones). R.A.B.I.D.s were AI \"killer\" pro- grams designed to resemble the late Bartmoss, created as a last thumb in the eye to his Corporate enemies. Powerful, homicidal, and ubiquitous, they infested the besieged NET in ever greater numbers. At first, they attacked only known Bartmoss targets like Arasaka and EBM. But as time went on and Rache (now dead) wasn't around to rein them in, the R.A.B.I.D.s evolved a murderous hatred of anyone they encountered. They also reproduced like—well—rabbits, creating a deadly pack of killer programs numbering in the hundreds of thousands, roving the NET looking for something to annihilate. the enD oF the net By the end of the War, the NET had been reduced to a terrifying wilderness of corrupted data, psychic booby traps, and rogue demon programs lurking in wait to destroy anyone foolhardy (or desperate) enough to venture into cyberspace. Unable to wipe out the DataKrash and overwhelmed by frenzied hordes of killer R.A.B.I.D.s, Netwatch finally gave up. On March 5th, 2023, Magnificent Curtis and the I-G Overwatch Council activated IGTA Dissolution Prime, propagating a code wave that crashed the I-G Protocols that allowed cyberdecks and NET-capable computers to reach cyberspace. The NET was dead. the GoveRnments steP in By October, local governments at the individual city and state levels began taking action, first by cutting off access to basic utilities and services, and by ruthlessly enforcing rules and regulations that the Megacorporations in pre-War times had been allowed to flout. Neither side was willing to openly confront this kind of activity; by this point, both sides needed the cash brought in by government service contracts too much to be able to default on them. Major governments also began to resist unrestricted Corporate warfare, first with words and later with actions. The EuroTheatre began to deploy limited, then ever stronger forces to confront the Corporate Armies in the field. In some cases, French, German, Scandinavian, and later Neo-Sov armies fought pitched battles outside key national areas such as Paris, Rome, Kyiv, Munich, and Helsinki. Faced with overwhelming opposition, the Corporations usually moved operations to less well-defended territories or were annihilated by the governmental forces. When a government moves in with troops, most wars ends quickly, at least in the civilized world. 256 WELCOME TO THE DARK FUTURE But as the War reached its most fevered and savage pitch, attacks become far more brutal, including massive attacks against each side's employees and facilities. In post-Collapse America, this was especially true as the fractured nature of the Disunited States made it nearly impossible to deploy the full might of the remaining U.S., Army, Air Force, and Navy forces. Having fought savagely for their Free State status in the previous decades, many of these pocket nation states were loath to invite in the armies of their one-time foes to deal with the Corporate incursions. Then came the Night City holocaust. the FAll oF niGht City On August 20th, 2023, unknown forces detonated a \"pocket nuke\" in the upper floors of the Arasaka Towers complex in Night City (on the western U.S. coast). The Nuke, while not a city-killer, reduced most of the central city to rubble and killed half a million people almost instantly. It was never formally decided who had triggered the Nuke; some partisans blamed Militech's overzealous desire to crush Arasaka, while still others blamed the detonation on an Arasaka area-denial weapon set off to protect its headquarters. the wAR enDs The Night City holocaust was the last straw. Within hours, then-U.S. President Elizabeth Kress nationalized Militech, placing it thoroughly under the control of the still sizable United States military, and banished all Arasaka forces from the continental U.S. under the threat of a retaliatory strike on Arasaka's Tokyo headquarters. Other nations swiftly followed the U.S.'s lead, nationalizing and/or interdicting assets of both participants of the War. The War was finally over. Now came the Aftermath.BY NEIL BRANQUINHO 257 BY 望瑾 JIN WANG the time of the redthe time of the red the aftermath of the 4th Corporate warthe aftermath of the 4th Corporate war \"I remember the day my whole world changed. I kind of knew in a vague way that there was a war going on, but it was very remote. My father never wanted to talk about it. And then, suddenly, my father was gone, my world was gone, the City I'd grown up in was gone—everything was gone. And it was all our fault.\" Michiko Sanderson (née Arasaka) 258 THE TIME OF THE RED T HE AFTERMATH In the aftermath of this worldwide conflict, atmospheric particles from the nuclear blast in Night City, as well as debris from orbital weapon strikes, continent-wide firestorms, conventional explosives, and the wartime burning and annihilation of cities and agricultural areas, cast an eerie red pall over skies worldwide. For nearly two years, skies were tinged a bloody red, which eventually died down to brilliant red sunrises and sunsets through the next decade. Known as the Time of the Red, this would be the backdrop for the first years of the post-War recovery, only fading away as the world's battered populations began to reconstruct their shattered cities. But despite the weak- ening of the atmospheric effects, the name has stuck among the war's survivors and, much as the 1920s was known as the Roaring Twenties and the 1930s as The Great Depression, in future histories the period between the end of the 4th Corp War and the present will probably always be referred to as the Time of the Red. So, the 4th Corporate War ground to a halt, and the Cyberpunk world started to begin its slow rebuilding. Through the red skies and periodic \"blood rains\" (caused when rainstorms pulled the crimson partic- ulate out of the skies and deposited it as a greasy crimson slime reminiscent of blood), the cities and nations of the world cleaned up the last pockets of Corporate resistance and got on with their lives. T HE U.S. IN THE TIME OF THE RED Superpower no more Since the end of the 4th Corp War the United States has lost much of its superpower status, but that doesn't matter much as most of Europe and the Far East are in the same position. What U.S. military still exists is organized as Combined Operations Groups (COGs): task forces that combine ships, aircraft, armor, and infantry into a cohesive fighting battalion; their main mission is to deal with threats to the BosWash Corridor and the federal government's interests. On the other hand, since the 4th Corporate War several of these COGs have broken away from the United States and are now operating as private armies for hire, personal mini kingdoms, or even marauding packs of well- armed raiders. FRAGmenteD AmeRiCA In many ways, the United States is very much as it was in the late 1800s—a \"civilized\" East Coast con- trolled by the federal government in Washington D.C., a \"Wild West\" of independent territories east of the Mississippi River, and an unincorporated West Coast from Seattle to Mexico. The territories are pretty much on their own, hiring local militia or mercenary armies to keep the peace, while the sprawl of Night City is maintained by its own system of interlocking local factions and power blocs. The United States' government is still primarily centered in the Boston-Washington Corridor (aka BosWash) from New York to Miami, where it oper- ates as the effective regional government much as the regional Councils do for Night City and the Pacifica Confederation. The branches of the federal government still operate as before: there are Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary branches—these just have little or no effect on anything past the Mississippi—and their members come almost exclusively from the East and near-Midwest. PResiDent kRess The current President is Elizabeth Kress: a hard-nosed, ex-military officer who was elected a year before the start of the now-infamous 4th Corporate War. Honest, fair, and tough enough to face down any threat to U.S. sovereignty, Kress has held the job for over a decade; \"re-elected\" four times in a total disregard for the rules on term limits, she is pretty much the only thing holding the U.S. together after years of war and collapse. niGht City Night City was the place hardest hit during the War, and the damage is still everywhere twenty-two years later. For starters, the city was surrounded by Militech forces and under total Arasaka control by the tail- end of the War. Street-to-street fighting was already savage, and in the last few days before the Nuke, had Some facilities have decon chambers people have to pass through before they're allowed entry. 259 THE TIME OF THE RED approached a fever pitch. In some ways, the detona- tion was to become a \"clean up\" end to a landscape already littered with burned buildings, wrecked vehi- cles, and dead bodies. Hanging over everything was a dense red pall (The Red) that painted everything the color of blood and poisoned the air for miles around. Post-War Night City was a wreck, but it was a wreck determined to rebuild. And one of the things that helped the most in the rebuilding process was the creation of a local alliance of \"Free States\" along the Pacific Northwest corridor: the Pacifica Confederation. the PACiFiCA ConFeDeRAtion Post-War, Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Northern California, and British Colombia unified into an ad hoc, loose grouping called the Pacifica Confederation. In the Time of the Red, the Confederation is busy rebuilding their infrastructure post-Corp War. They also host several large U.S. government bases that have permanent leases, but do not otherwise exercise much control on the population. The Confed is a natural outgrowth of the State Succession period that broke up much of the Old United States. Its members are distinctly \"federalist,\" interfering in each other's internal affairs only when those affairs cross the border. The biggest thing they share is a loathing for the mess the Megacorps left behind, and a dismissive shrug at the ineffectual U.S. government. A City oF DAnGeRous DReAms The Confederation has allowed Night City to survive as an independent \"city-state.\" In turn, the rebuilding city has become a free trade zone for the Confederation, as well as an entry point for the rest of the world when it doesn't want to deal with the remain- der of the United States. In the Time of the Red, Night City is a cybernetic Casablanca, and like its famous cinematic counterpart it's dangerous, lawless, and a great place to make the Big Score. sAsquAtCh is wAtChinG One other useful thing: in the process of rebuilding, the Washington/Oregon territories of the Confederation have allowed Biotechnica, free rein to design and release a number of experimental plants and animals that they hope will restore the once-burgeoning ecology. So be careful out there in the woods, kids. mAintAininG the PoweR bAlAnCe Overall, the Pacifica Confederation is a powerful eco- nomic region; it is a main trade port to what remains of Asia, with access to a lot of military power as well. The local Combined Operations Groups at Bremerton and Ft. Lewis/McChord have generally supported the stable and sensible locals over the unstable main U.S. government. Kress' New United States is going to have to work hard indeed to woo this Confederation into an allied membership where they can work with Washington D.C. in exchange for a great deal of independent governance. The Confederation's members are also willing to work with the rising new Megacorps, but on their own stringent terms; a sort of \"Screw up, Mister Megacorp, and we'll call on our friends at Lewis/McChord to flatten you.\" But they are too economically powerful to need to actually sell out to the new Megas and that's not going to change much in the next few decades. So, while the Corps are as ubiquitous as they are in Night City, they walk a much more careful line knowing that the locals are capable of waging their own Corporate War against them. In the Time of the Red, this relationship is in the process of being defined, and the Corps are currently learning the hard way that the Seattle/Vancouver/ Victoria/Night City boys do not fool around. In the Time of the Red, everyone walks lightly around the Pacifica Confed. T he Players and the Game the big picture in 2045 If the 2020s were dominated by the Megacorps, the playing field has now shifted back into balance. Nations, governments, and other NGO (non-gov- ernmental organizations) now vie for control of the rebuilding world. Here are just a few of the most important players and where they stand in the Great Game of Power Politics.

Here is a brief overview of just a few of the major players who have shaped the Cyberpunk world since the 4th Corporate Wars ended. T he World Beyond Beyond the borders of the remaining United States is a world in flux. uniteD euRoPe The EuroTheatre has been badly battered by the War and the subsequent loss of its ESA and Orbital colonies to the Highriders. The World Stock Exchange and the Common Market have managed to maintain a stable economy in which most of the European nations participate—the exceptions are Italy, Spain, and Greece—all of which are now suffering violent, chronic political upheavals. Here, the international Corporations still have a great deal of power, but various Euro-governments have skillfully used the War to keep the Euro business barons under control. Great Britain has suffered major economic trouble; swamped by massive immigration from the U.S. and an antiquated technological base, its streets are still almost as explo- sively dangerous as those of the U.S. The rest of Europe is in recovery mode as individual nation states struggle to rebuild damaged financial and industrial hubs affected by the War. neo-soviet RussiA Beyond the massive reforms of the 1990s, Neo-Soviet Russia is still weakened by its antiquated technology. Even now, it cannot fully feed its hungry population (although the 4th Corporate War has leveled the playing field a bit). With the failure of the economic and social reforms of the Novosovetskaya partiya (NSP), a new generation of highly-ag- gressive oligarchs is coming on fast. Unlike their NSP predecessors who were content to simply siphon off the remaining assets of the State like the good Corporate robber barons they were, these oligarchs are more akin to the Megacorporates of the roaring 2020s: hungry, dangerous, and willing to use heavier amounts of bribery, murder, and mayhem to accomplish their aims than ever before. the miDDle eAst The Meltdown of the '90s left vast areas of Iran, Libya, Iraq, Chad, and the Arab Emirates as radioactive fields of glass. Only Egypt, Syria, and Israel survived intact, and because of their already ruined state were mercifully left alone for most of the War. But new alliances and power blocs are struggling to take control once again now that the Megacorp's power has been curtailed. With the world trade in oil and raw materials disrupted by Corporate conflict, there is a new interest in mining the remains of the Meltdown nations, and in response many of the national groups in the Middle East are starting to band together to reform and resist the invaders. ciTizenshiP in The Time of The red In the fractured world of the Time of the Red, citi- zenship has become a fluid thing. You can't just limit it to something only nations can grant, because that nation that gave you a fancy cer- tificate proclaiming you a citizen could be gone tomorrow. So, citizens in the Time of the Red are more like the citizens of the old Greek City states; their alliances are to the place they live or the tribe they are part of. You may even hold citi- zenship in several places; you could be a citizen of the Pacifica Confederaton, Night City, and a Nomad Family like the Aldecaldos. Each of these relation- ships has its own ways and rituals for granting \"citizenship.\"BY EDDIE MENDOZA 261 THE TIME OF THE RED FutuRist AFRiCA The African states have now established solid footholds in space; nearly one third of all space construction workers are African, and the majority of spaceport facilities and construction areas are on African soil. The resulting population has evolved into a \"national\" group called the Highriders; a space-based, high-tech society linked by Pan- African roots and a determination never to be victims of colonial oppression again. Declaring their independence during the War (and enforcing it with commandeered orbital weapons), the Highrider Assembly is carefully neutral in the Time of the Red, ready to deal with all sides as long as their sovereignty (and control of space) is respected. The War barely touched the rising new cities of Africa, who were well protected by the killsats and deltas of their Highrider relatives. Several cities in Africa count among the most futuristic and advanced habitations on the planet, with their star-scraping buildings shaped from Orbital titanium and open parks sweeping around the busy streets. CentRAl AnD south AmeRiCA During the War, nationalistic factions in Brazil and Colombia used the Corporate fighting to support their own bids for land and influence; the result was a shat- tering of the old alliance that only now is beginning to be rebuilt. But the Organization of American States soon rallied and, with the help of strong economic partners like Argentina and a newly democratic Brazil, are rebuilding their cities and establishing new trading partners, especially with the Highriders and the Nomads. AsiA AnD the FAR eAst The Far East and Asia are now a hodgepodge of damaged nations, with Japan slowly recovering from the ravages of the Arasaka Corporation's abor- tive coup. China is still recovering from the loss of Hong Kong through a biological terror attack, and fierce battles in both the South China Sea and the Mongolian Plateau for access to strategic resources has left the government exhausted and tottering. The 262 THE TIME OF THE RED Koreas, fractured again by the 4th Corporate War, have become strongly isolationist, although North Korea, drawn into the conflict by promises of Arasaka support, has collapsed into a chaos of warlords and petty fiefdoms. Hammered by brutal fighting over trade routes and oilfields, much of Southeast Asia, the Philippines, and Australia are now isolated, damaged and potentially prey to the next powerful group to come along. Asia is a long way from the boom times of the 2020s. the DRiFt nAtions During the 4th Corporate War, many of the floating work platforms and drift cities of OTEC and its rival CINO were the epitome of oceanic technology. The most famous of these floating cities is AquaDelphi, the former home and headquarters of the OTEC Corporation, near Hawaii. Other floating cities, like Florida's Atlantis, are somewhat smaller, while still others began as shantytowns constructed from old oil rigs or jury-rigged platforms made from abandoned, lashed-together oil tankers (as is the case with the Offshore Colonies in the Gulf of Mexico). Pirates, hostile Corporate navies, and the perils of the open ocean threatened to wipe out these individ- ual cities during and after the War, but by banding together in loose confederations, these \"drift cities\" (more properly named Drift Nations) are now small nation-states unto themselves, located in international waters with their own defense forces, making them hubs of international shipping and import/export—a true no-man's land of free-living fringe folk. And as terminals for the expanding trade network that has replaced the old shipping webs before the War, the Drift Nations are now a center of both \"pirate\" and legitimate Nomad activity. the DeePDown Over the past two decades, the Corporations expanded not only into space, but into the ocean depths as well. This web of deep-sea domes and facilities were scattered across the continental shelves of most of the continents, with even some very secre- tive ones located deep in the Atlantic and Pacific trenches. The domes varied greatly in size, ranging in capacity from twenty people up to as many as a few thousand. Besides the many research domes, there were semi-submerged \"green farms\" where krill and crypropalan (two essential items in day-to-day life) were harvested and processed, in addition to more exotic seafood. The other major sub-sea industry was deep-sea mining for rare and valuable minerals and oil. An extremely dangerous profession (although technology made the work far safer than several decades earlier), working and living in these undersea facilities still gradually became the everyday world for several thousand people, who began to refer to this community of subsurface cities as \"The Deepdown.\" During the War, the Deepdown survived by cutting any links to the surface and becoming as invisible as possible. Dome dwellers developed active camouflage systems that hid their locations from prowling combat subs and their weapons. Even now, the full extent of the Deepdown is uncharted, as the \"Deepdowners\" don't trust the Corps to not drop a few torpedoes or depth charges on their fragile domes (as happpened often during the 4th Corporate War). Only recently have they begun to forge tentative links with the Drift Nations, whom they use as a safe go-between with the Nomads and other non-affiliated groups. the hiGhRiDeR ConFeDeRAtion Mid-war, the Highriders made the choice to not become involved in the harsh Corporate conflict below Low Earth Orbit. In the Seven-Hour War, the Low Earth Orbit colonies and the Highriders at O'Neill Two declared independence, using commandeered deltas and mass drivers to drop lunar rocks and other \"ortillery\" at key sites all over the planet. Given no choice, the EuroTheatre, the remnant U.S., and Japan officially recognized the new government, ceding control of Earth Space to the Confederation. The \"L\" (or La Grange Stationary) Points are now home to literally hundreds of long-duration, self-contained bases, factories, and construction sites. At the L points also orbit the largest space constructions in existence: the roughly toroidal Crystal Palace space station (L-1), the mammoth O'Neill One Habitat (L-5) Paradise Station (L-4), and the smaller Galileo Cylinder (L-3). Behind the Moon sits the L-2 point, home of the ESA's test-bed cylinder and deep space explorer dock. And since the early 2000s, ESA and its allied nations have Another example of a Drift Nation is the Metakey, an artificial island constructed by the Meta Nomads. 263 THE TIME OF THE RED also maintained permanent bases on Luna; networks of subsurface tunnels with water provided through mining Lunar ice and air from hydroponic gardens (lit by rolling back huge shutters on the surface). There are two permanent cities on Luna, both now controlled by the Highriders. Tycho/Luna Colony, the largest, main- tains two massdrivers, used to boost Lunar rock and ore out to the L-5 constructions. The second colony, at Copernicus, supports a single mass driver, and a pop- ulation of around 12,000. Even ignoring the fledgling colonies on Mars, the Highrider Confederation is one of the most powerful forces on (or around) the planet, easily dominating the ground-side governments. The \"groundpounders\" know this and are constantly trying to undermine and regain control of space. The outcome is still in dispute and will probably remain so for some time. the Ais Discussing the place of Artificial Intellects (AIs) in the post-War period is...messy. Firstly, the War had created or influenced multiple types of what Netwatch called AIs as servants, slaves, or inadvertent victims. And although humans in the meat world still tend to lump them all together into one big ominous box marked \"AIs\" the reality is that the various types of machine intelligences all have their own factions and goals. Soulkilled Pseudo Intellects (SPI) are AIs that were originally actual people but have had their consciousness digitized and now exist only on computers in the NET. The process is often not vol- untary—Soulkiller programs produce this type of AI. Otherwise indistinguishable from Symbolic Analysis AIs, these \"ghosts\" were created in huge numbers as Arasaka put its infamous Soulkiller program to work targeting enemies and rivals alike. The majority of these SPIs have gathered in sanctuaries around deserted mainframes and city systems abandoned by Corporations or (as in the case of a number of bio-plague attacked cities along the Asian Rim) totally abandoned cities. Most of these \"ghosts\" just want a safe place to live; rumor has it that Alt Cunningham, the creator of Soulkiller and a digital ghost herself, has created a number of \"ghost towns\" in hidden places all over the remains of the Old NET. They pretty much want to be left alone. Critical Pathway Plateau (CPP) AIs are those that come into existence by accident. A company may be trying to create a very complex program that, by coincidence, becomes sapient. Their personalities can vary widely: they may appear indistinguishable from people, or they may behave in completely alien ways. Because they are not deliberately programmed from the start to be AIs, the final form their personality takes is impossible to predict. These are the types most often branded by the media and Netwatch as Rogue AIs. Rogue AIs are AIs who have decided that interacting with human as \"employees\" is not for them; they have slipped into the NET and set up their own shop, where they survive by finding a computer mainframe to reside in that has been abandoned or is not cur- rently in use. They can reside for a time in the Old NETs sub-processors and relay stations, but this is a dangerous prospect because they are extremely vulnerable in this position. Eventually, they must find another computer to hang out in. And like all CPP AIs, rogues want bandwidth and storage space and are willing to steal it or even kill living humans to get it. The infamous R.A.B.I.D.s (digital Rache Bartmoss clones who roam the remnants of the Old NET looking for victims to harass and murder) are a form of CPP AI, which is one reason why these types are so feared. For the most part, since War's end, the Rogues have been in a fierce struggle with Netwatch to claim control of what's left of the Old NET for themselves. They've been so successful that by early 2023, Netwatch was forced to shut down the major server paths and backbones of the NET for the foreseeable future. Transcendental Sentience (TS) AIs are emer- gent AIs which were not programmed or created by anyone, instead emerging from the creation of huge operating systems that pervade an entire region of the Old NET. They are therefore an emergent prop- erty of the OldNET. By their nature, TS AIs are so large that most people cannot interact with them. Even when they can, conventional communication isn't really possible because the AIs are incapable of understanding any existence outside of themselves. To most, the mere existence of these AIs is highly debat- able, and outside of those who know better there's no consensus on whether they're actually real. These AIs 264 THE TIME OF THE RED are the type of machine intelligences that Netwatch and the Corps fear the most; they are extremely powerful, and their overall goals are unknown. On the other hand, TS AIs seem to be the one group of NET entities able to control all other digital personality fac- tions. As a result, Netwatch is now trying to broker some kind of \"deal\" with the Transcendental Sentience AIs (with Alt Cunningham and her ghosts operating as go-betweens) to allow the Old NET to be reestablished in some mutually acceptable form. netwAtCh Established in the early days of the NET, Netwatch is a policing orga- nization founded as part of a U.S./ EuroTheatre treaty. Although technically a non-governmental agency that came out of a security company based in London, England, in reality Netwatch worked in tandem with, and received most of its funding from, governments, Megacorporations, and other large semi-governmental organizations. Before the War, Netwatch's job was to patrol the NET looking for illegal activity, covering various \"territories\" based on the regional maps established with the imple- mentation of the Ihara-Grubb protocols. Equipped with the best cyberdecks, pow- erful hunter-killer software, and an almost unlimited source of funding, Netwatch attracted the best of the best Netrunners: players who loved taking on the top \"black-hat hackers\" in one-on-one NET combat. But as the War heated up, both sides unleashed terrifying new programs and Black ICE to devastate the other. In the end, it took the psychopathic brilliance of master Netrunner Rache Bartmoss to devise a way that not only destroyed the NET, but also made sure even Netwatch couldn't fix what he'd done. So, for the past twenty-two years, Netwatch has been a police force without a beat. Their main job has been to act as lifeguards, finding renegade 'runners who've managed to find a backdoor into the now off-limits Old NET and are being torn to ribbons by the bad stuff that now inhabits \"The Dungeon\" (as Netwatch pros and 'runners now called the old NET Architecture). They bail the weefle runners out and then run for cover before the really awful Black ICE descends upon them like the hammer of Thor. But recently, with the help of Alt Cunningham and a mysterious cabal of Transcendental AIs, Netwatch head, Magnificent Curtis and his crack team have been able to write software that could tackle the Black ICE and R.A.B.I.D.s that have infested the Old NET. And behind the scenes, the Transcendentals, the Ghosts, and Net watch have been working together on a project to get the NET under control; a project that exists on no books or official documents, known only by the ominous title of The Black Wall. T he NeoCorps The 4th Corporate War ended the age of Corporate domination. Even if they were not involved in the shooting parts of the War, many Megacorps found their operations fatally wounded through the breakdown of communications, NET information systems, global transport disruption, and collateral damage. the new CoRPs suRvive But the Megas aren't out of the picture entirely. In many cases, local or regional offices continued to operate in a reduced capacity—if they could get the materials and funding to do so. These companies sometime renamed themselves but con- tinued, where possible, to provide the services they were known for. Some Corps The corP GraVeyard Not every Corp survived the chaos of the 4th Corporate War. There were a variety of victims who went down either by association, over exten- sion, or just plan \"they were in the way\"-ism. Among the denizens of the Corporate Graveyard are: Adrek Robotics: This high end robotics Corp had a long-standing rivalry with Arasaka. During the 4th Corp War, Arasaka wiped out Adrek's best minds using Soulkiller. After the War, Zhirafa bought out many of their factories. I n f o co mp: A n o t h e r victim of the DataKrash. Infocomp's stock in trade was brokering information and that all got ruined by Bartmoss' virus. International Electric Corporation (IEC): Once a prominent and diverse Megacorp, creating every- thing from baby powder to war machines. IEC was a competitor of both Arasaka and Militech and, so, a major target during the 4th Corp War. Techtronica: A t e c h Corp best known for their Microwaver line. The company died with the CEO during the 4th Corp War but their designs live on, replicated by many other Corporations and street Techs. 265 THE TIME OF THE RED (like Raven Microcyb and Kiroshi) broke into smaller units that shared a common trade dress but were often run by entirely different Corporate officers. Still other Corps just fell apart entirely and found their assets seized by other competitors or ambitious regional managers hoping to carve off a personal Corporate fiefdom. The result is that in the Time of the Red, the Megacorps aren't all that mega anymore. These \"Corpos\" (as they are dubbed on The Street) are closer to what Corporations were in the mid-to-late 20th century: local companies powerful on a regional or national level, but without the enormous interna- tional reach of the roaring 2020s period. ...AnD ARe still DAnGeRous This doesn't mean they're toothless—far from it. Corps in the Time of the Red are, if anything, more rapacious and power hungry. There are fewer rules out there and ambitious players in the front office are willing to do practically anything to gain the advantage over a resource or market. They may not be able to field giant armies with tanks and troops, but they can still deploy powerful covert ops squads and bribe the right governmental overseers to allow them to take out their enemies when it's important enough. Unfortunately for them, in this post-War environment, the most deter- mined Edgerunners can also field hardware and advantages often equal to those of smaller Corps. And there are even a fair number of Edgerunners using the open market to start their own \"baby Corps\" to take on the tottering \"old guys.\" There's a new and dangerous game to be played out in the marketplace, and in this fragmented new age, everyone can play. the CoRPoRAte lADDeR Corporations are usually organized as a vast hierar- chy, with a President and Board of Directors at the top, and a huge sea of workers at the bottom. In the middle tiers, one finds the realm of the Corporate executive, a struggling middle class overachiever, usually with the single-minded goal of grabbing as much power and privilege as possible. The average Corporate begins as a junior execu- tive, \"bossing\" a particular project or group of people. At the next level, they become a Manager, controlling a specific department or production area. The major infighting begins here—only very successful Managers get elevated to the position of Assistant Vice President, where they control entire factories or other operations. They are, in turn, bossed by Vice Presidents, who control entire divisions of the company. the CoRneR oFFiCe Near the top is the Executive Vice President, who effectively runs the Corporation. Their boss is the President, who answers only to the Board of Directors (major stockholders) and the Chairman of the Board. Theoretically, Corporate advancement is based on merit. In reality, the Corporate world is rife with nepo- tism, deal making, brown nosing, cheating, lying, and credit stealing. Extortion, blackmail, and frame-ups are common. teAmwoRk is eveRythinG One of the most disturbing factors in this web of Corporate power brokering is the Team: a personal \"guard\" of workers who do the dirty work for a par- ticular Exec. Almost every Corporate Exec employs at least one force of highly trained covert operatives spe- cializing in espionage, counter-espionage, sabotage, and counter-terrorism. In extreme cases, measures such as assassination and terrorism are not unknown, whether against other Corporations or within the Corporate structure itself. A Corporate covert opera- tions arm is usually made up of weapons specialists, computer technicians, and various \"hired guns\"— almost all of these covert forces are cyberenhanced you know the you know the oldold sAyinG, sAyinG, \"leAD FRom the FRont\"? thAt's \"leAD FRom the FRont\"? thAt's bullshitbullshit. the best PlACe to . the best PlACe to leAD FRom is the bACk. thAt wAy leAD FRom is the bACk. thAt wAy you CAn you CAn shootshoot An unDeRlinG iF An unDeRlinG iF they betRAy you. oR iF they'Re they betRAy you. oR iF they'Re Just not Just not usefuluseful AnymoRe.

Covert action arms frequently search the dead zones and arcologies to recruit promising young criminals, promising them high pay, the best enhancements, and a life of glamor and adventure. GolDen hAnDCuFFs In the savage world of Big Business, it's not unusual for an executive to jump from firm to firm, looking for a big success. To prevent this, most Corporations require their employees to sign Employment Contracts, specifying how long they must work for the firm until they can quit. Contracts may run from a year for a low-level executive, to an entire lifetime for a key researcher or company president. The penalties for breaking Employment contracts are extremely severe, ranging from garnishment of wages, to lawsuits, and even loss of licenses in the case of lawyers or physicians. Corporations have also been known to use sabotage, software, and deadly booby traps to ensure loyalty. Blackmail is common. Assassination and kidnapping are expected. This makes Corporate \"headhunting\" (hiring away another company's staff for use by your own company) a deadly game of cat and mouse. Most Corporations have their own \"extraction teams\" of Solos who, like the KGB or CIA, arrange \"defections\" of key personnel from one side to the other. Headhunting can be especially lethal as most Corporations will use any and all means to stop a rival extraction team. PoweR shiFts Since the end of the 4th Corporate War, most national governments are no longer in the uncomfortable posi- tion of having to let the multinational Corporations do pretty much as they please. Where once they paid lip service to pollution control, product safety, and minimum wage rules, the modern Megacorp is now forced to strike a bargain with the local government. Sometimes this may be as simple as a bribe to the right places, or military support for the local dictator. In the more scrupulous New United States, Corporations tread especially lightly, going out of their way to hide their more illegal operations, and make sure to toe the line in their more visible ones; Washington D.C. is watching and its fist is like iron, ready at all times to crush a miscreant. But in Night City's looser Free State environment, it's more often a case of trading power, influence, or money with the right leaders: a judge or police chief here, a councilman or official there. the Rule oF the FACes One final thing that has come about since the end of the 4th Corporate War has been a rewriting of the rules of Corporate responsibility. No longer can a Megacorp hide behind the \"Corporate shield\" of the past that allowed so many CEOs and their Boards to evade responsibility for their more nefarious activi- ties. As an absolute requirement for filing legitimate Articles of Incorporation in the EuroTheatre, China, the Free States, and even the New United States, a Corporation must assign the single largest stockholder of the Corporation as its \"Face,\" a living person who is personally responsible for any malfeasance commit- ted by the Megacorp they control. If the Corporation is found out to have committed murder, fraud, or other illegal activities, the Face must legally take the punish- ment for the transgression. This could end up as a long prison term or, in the most egregious cases—like indus- trial accidents such as the infamous Union Carbide Bhopal disaster—even the death penalty. Obviously, this is intended to ensure that the current \"Face\" keeps their company out of trouble. Or at least makes sure whatever trouble it gets into isn't connected directly to the management of the Corporation.

Even after a major war, Arasaka still maintains one of the largest armed forces of any Corporation. And though their operations are severely reduced and their headquarters are limited to the Japanese mainland, Arasaka has managed, even in defeat, to hold on to most of its assets thanks to its strong alliance with the official government of Japan. Most of the time, post-War, Arasaka troops are covertly licensed out to other firms around the world as Corporate security guards, couriers, and mercenaries, but usually wearing the uniforms of their new \"employers.\" The best trained and hardest operatives in the security business, they follow their client's orders second only to Arasaka's. To the Arasaka Corporation, however, they are loyal to the point of death. Arasaka is more about protecting its own damaged assets than protecting other companies, so they often use their position of trust with major Corporations around the world to gain inside information, contacts, and advantages that will help them to realize their ultimate goal of returning to the political and economic heights they once held. 268 THE TIME OF THE RED Arasaka may be under the nominal control of Saburo Arasaka, but as in any powerful organization there are always factions vying for dominance. As of the 2040s, there are three major factions struggling to come out on top. All the while hoping that Old Man Saburo will eventually hand the crown over to them. The Arasaka Factions as of 2045 are: The Kiji 雉 (Green Pheasant) Faction: Led by Hanako, this faction is basically a continuation of the main- line, Saburo-controlled regime. But as Hanako is something of a recluse, more interested in her Netrunning experiments than in gathering power, the Kiji faction is mostly trying to maintain the Corporation according to Saburo Arasaka's sweeping vision. The Taka 鷹 (Hawk) Faction: Led by Yorinobu, Saburo's second son. He's still a renegade who opposes the other factions to his own ends. Thought to have been Soulkilled by his elder brother Kei, it turned out that the person who ended up under the probes was a body double; Yorinobu made sure that during the War he was impossible to find. As long as his father Saburo (or the Kiji Faction) are in control, Yorinobu will still be out there trying to bring about its downfall. Hato 鳩 (Dove) Faction: Centered on Michiko Sanderson (née Arasaka), Kei's only daughter and Saburo's granddaughter. This faction has allied itself behind the American-born Arasaka, although in truth the youngest member of the clan wants nothing to do with her family's machinations. But as a figurehead, the Hato Faction considers her a valuable asset that will provide them legitimacy should they take command after Saburo's death. ▶ Face: Hanako Arasaka ◀ The eldest Arasaka daughter, Hanako has always been a bit of a recluse. A Netrunner of high skill, she has always preferred to work on her digital projects, particularly a revised version of Soulkiller that will allow movement into clone bodies (only she grasped the true meaning of Alt Cunningham's work). However, with the fall of Kei, the remainder of the Old Guard (mostly old commanders under Kei) have unified around her and want to continue Saburo and Kei's plans as the Kiji Faction. They represent the faction that hopes for a peaceful reconciliation with the New U.S. and Hanako is their figurehead. She is also instrumental in getting her brother, Yorinobu to reconcile with the Family. bioteChniCA Genetic engineering, microbiological, and biochemical research Headquarters: La Jolla, California Regional Offices: London, Bonn, Paris, Seattle, Dallas, Night City, Sydney, Rio de Janeiro Chief Officer/Designer: Nicolo Loggagia Employees: 36,256 ▶ Background ◀ When the fuel crisis really began to affect the industrialized community in the late 1990s, Biotechnica, then a small firm with only one office, came up with the answer: CHOOH 2 TM (pronounced 'chew two'). CHOOH 2 (not its actual chemical formula) is a complex grain alcohol produced by genetically engineered yeasts and wheat strains created by Biotechnica. The potential of CHOOH 2 was realized almost immediately after it was introduced, and within a few years, all fuel-burning vehicles and power plants had converted to the new product. Although Biotechnica held worldwide patents, it lacked the production facilities to meet worldwide demand, forcing it to license production to several large Agricorps and PetroCorps. These deals made Biotechnica an 269 THE TIME OF THE RED extremely wealthy, but still not particularly large, company. Biotechnica is also probably the closest thing to a \"good guy\" Corporation in the Time of the Red. Its labs have provided much of the tech that enabled the Pacific Confed to develop new bio-engineered \"replacement species,\" and Biotechnica is active in restoring both animals and habitat throughout the blighted environments of this era. ▶ Face: Nicolo Loggagia ◀ A brilliant but erratic biochemist, Nicolo Loggagia has taken what began as a small company based out of an industrial park in Rome and made it into one of the most important Corporations in the world. Biotechnica is still relatively small, hardly what constitutes a true \"Megacorp,\" but it punches well above its weight with the scale of its creations, such as the CHOOH 2 development that powers most of the vehicles in the world. And behind almost all of these is Loggagia: a slight, white-haired, dapper man with a slightly abstracted air about him. Loggagia likes to make things. Useful chemicals. Biological tools. Artificial life forms. He doesn't often think of what he'll do with his creations; he leaves that to his grandson Mario and his wife Luchessia, who handle most of the business aspects of the firm. But that's because Nicolo is pursuing a dream. Since childhood, Loggagia has wanted to restore the biosphere of the planet, starting with endangered flora and fauna and working up to recreating some of the most interesting (to his far-ranging mind) extinct animals throughout history. Loggagia, however, is a practical man. He knows if he recreates such now-extinct wonders as pandas and koala bears, the greedy and rapacious forces of the world will soon destroy his reborn creations. So Nicolo has redesigned many of his favorite animals with both defensive and offensive capabilities that they previously lacked—koalas with venomous fangs, for example. He's also been experimenting with creating new bio-engineered flora and fauna to restore his favorite ecosystems: the color shifting pattern-panthers now moving into the Northwest forests, or the spotted ptero-raptors that have started to infest the heights of the Canadian Rockies. Nicolo is a pleasant and likable man who exudes an old-world charm that immediately endears him to those he meets. On the other hand, he may well also be the Doctor Moreau of the Time of the Red. ContinentAl bRAnDs Organic and synthetics food and drink Headquarters: Tulsa, Oklahoma Regional Offices: Chicago, Atlanta, Baltimore, Seattle, Dallas, Night City Chief Officer: Olivia Forsythe Employees: 147,000 ▶ Background ◀ Petrochem's monopoly on the production of CHOOH 2 in the United States meant that any surplus crop of Triticum Vulgaris Megasuavis, the wheat from which the fuel is made, had to be completely absorbed by the company. Having no additional incentive to produce more CHOOH 2 in any given year within the walled garden of their American monopoly, Petrochem turned to their subsidiary food business, Continental Agricorp of Tulsa, OK, to answer this problem. Petrochem tasked the Continental Agricorp's American New Products Division with an important mission: find new ways to sell Americans more food than they bought the previous year. With each passing year, surpluses of T. megasuavis in the U.S. became larger, and the work of selling through the wheat fell increasingly heavy on the American New Products Division. 270 THE TIME OF THE RED The constant pressure to produce exponential year-on-year growth, combined with a lack of oversight from their parent company, created an office environment so toxic that it seemed to eat people alive, only to replace them just as rapidly. What rose from this poison swamp was the cross-factional alliance of the New Beverages Marketing Director, Olivia Forsythe, and the New Foods Marketing Director, Lewis \"Mr. Moo-Moo Burger\" McAllister, each served by brand mangers loyal to them alone. In secret, in the summer of 2040, they drafted a plan to cut out the ultimate middleman in their business: Petrochem. They began to consolidate power—and over the course of three years they put half of Petrochem's American Agribusiness into the legal equivalent of a large sack and hoisted it over their shoulder. In preparation for their move they brought half of Petrochem's CHOOH-4U gas stations, lobbying, and research and development in-house. One morning, all affected staff were made aware. Continental Agricorp was no longer their employer, but Continental Brands was. While they were no longer affiliated with Petrochem, the move came with a tidy pay increase. In court, Petrochem's legal team in their home state of Texas argued that it was the greatest single theft of property, both intellectual and otherwise in recorded history, but the case was quickly dismissed. In a final twist of the knife, Continental Brands had stolen the judge, too. ▶ Face: Olivia Forsythe ◀ The Face of Continental Brands is Olivia Forsythe. To the public, she is the Kibble Queen, a persona created entirely by her marketing department. The Kibble Queen is best known as the mascot of their Oasis stores, which launched shortly after they \"left\" Petrochem to capitalize on the food instability created by the Time of the Red. Their business model was simple. If an Oasis was the only place to reliably purchase food and only sold their brands, then profit was assured. Once an Oasis is established, the community is entered into the Oasis Community Loyalty Program. Pleasing the Kibble Queen by purchasing large quantities of foods or electing local representatives supported by Continental Brands earns points for the whole community. Likewise, displeasing the Kibble Queen by importing food from outside the community, growing your own food, or publicly organizing against Continental Brands results in a point penalty. High loyalty values bring community-wide rewards like prioritized shipments of food, more chips in every bag of ChocoKibble, and upon first reaching Gold status a royal visit from a body double of Olivia Forsythe, throwing company merch from an AV-4. Low loyalty values result in punishments like lowered food quality and increased prices. Known enemies of Continental Brands hiding within the community will have old-fash- ioned \"Wanted\" posters drawn up and put outside their local Oasis, with point bonuses given for informing on their last known address. The worst community punishment is admission into the Discovery Program, which forces the community into testing a single new flavor of kibble by removing all other offerings until their loyalty score improves. Olivia is a home-grown monster of the Corporate world, filled with malice toward everything that does not directly benefit her.

She also unilaterally hates the brands she worked for on her way up the company ladder, with the exception the first brand she helped bring to market for Petrochem, Triti-Fizz, which she considers her greatest achievement. Habitually, she drinks six cans a day and does two lines of synthcoke in the morning. She hates the spotlight put on her by being a Face and wants nothing more than to slink back into the shadows of the Corporate office, where she's always done her best work. DAnGeR GiRl Private investigation and security firm Headquarters: Night City Regional Offices: New York, Miami, Montreal, London, Rome, Zurich, Night City, Washington D.C., Los Angeles, Toronto Chief Officer: Michiko Sanderson Employees: 1,800 ▶ Background ◀ As the Arasaka Corporation faced defeat at the hands of the U.S. military, it was forced to pull almost all its operations back to the core zaibatsu in Japan. The loss of the current operations chief, Kei Arasaka, eldest son of the family-owned business, threw control of the vast security firm back into the hands of the family patriarch: the centenarian Saburo Arasaka. Even at his advanced age, the elder Arasaka had not lost his ability to plan strategically, or to inspire both loyalty and utter terror in his subordinates. But in America, Kei's only daughter, Michiko, faced her own dilemma. Her family company was now hated worldwide as one of the instigators of a terrible war, as well as having a reputation for mass-murder based on the accusation that they had detonated a nuclear device in the center of a major American city. Michiko, a sheltered seventeen-year-old high schooler, had, of course, known very little of her elder family's world-spanning machinations and her father had made certain to keep her away from the more unsavory side of the family business. With the Arasaka Corporation now persona non grata in the Americas, Michiko faced being deported to Japan, a distant nation that, as an American-born and raised teenager, was utterly alien to her. Michiko's solution was to lean heavily into her strengths. She was young, adorably cute, and possessed of a high IQ. She already had thousands of devoted young fans all over the world who were willing to take it as gospel that she was an innocent caught up in her \"evil\" family's misdeeds. She started by traveling to Washington D.C. to meet with the President, Elizabeth Kress, to both apologize for her family's part in the War and to plead her case to remain an American citizen. It's not entirely known what Michiko and Kress discussed, but in the end Michiko was allowed to remain in America to finish her high school career and then enter Stanford University, where she majored in—of all things—criminology. When she graduated three years later, she started her own business. As a detective. Danger Girl is the name of Michiko's new company. On the surface, it is a private investigation firm specializing in cases for celebrities and other socially important clients. As its perky, unstoppable head, Michiko is a staple of parties and events from New Hollywood to the hot spots of recovering Europe. Her visible naivete and irrepressible charm disguise the fact that she's also a highly competent criminologist. It also obscures the fact that behind the scenes, she's fulfilling one of the directives she agreed to perform as part of her deal with Elizabeth Kress to remain on American soil: locating and dismantling any Arasaka Corp operations in and around the United States. 272 THE TIME OF THE RED Danger Girl is a carefully constructed fiction. While Michiko's clients are all well-heeled and socially prominent enough to pay her astronomical fees, the company also has access to a slush fund provided covertly by President Kress, as well as access to much of the covert databases left behind in the Arasaka estate in New Westbrook. She also has access to a bodyguard, Kenichi Zaburo, once one of Arasaka's top Solos and her personal bodyguard since she was four. For two decades, Danger Girl has been making headlines with its high-society cases and daring exploits, all the while playing a lethal undercover chess game against the warring factions of her deadly family. Don't let the bright pink logo of the \"Little Detective\" icon fool you. When you cross Danger Girl, you're messing with fire. ▶ Face: Michiko Sanderson (née Arasaka) ◀ You couldn't invent a better Face than Michiko Sanderson (her new name taken when she married her partner, detective Marc Sanderson, after a particularly exciting case). Now in her thirties, she still exudes the same bubbly, enthusiastic charm that won the world over in her teens. A constant sight at almost any important social gala, Michiko has a string of successfully solved cases that have made Danger Girl the detective firm you want to handle your case, whether it's to recover a stolen diamond-encrusted cyberlimb, or to extract your Executive husband from the clutches of a dangerous Megacorp. Michiko has grown into an elegant, lovely woman who can read a room like a book and yet never reveals anything to her suspects other than her happy, cheerful facade. Behind her, although not as visible as he was in her early career, is still the formidable figure of Ken Zaburo, the only man who could take on Morgan Blackhand and battle him to a draw.

Regional Offices: New York, Miami, Chicago, Montreal, London, Rome, Zurich, Night City, Washington, Los Angeles, Toronto, Tokyo, Beijing Chief Officer: Gen. Donald Lundee, USMC (ret.) Employees: 350,000 (700,000 Contracted to the U.S. Military) ▶ Background ◀ One of the major players in the 4th Corporate War, MTI fought rival, Arasaka Corp to a bloody standstill that ended only when the Megacorp was ordered to stand down by the President of the remnant United States. This didn't set well with Militech's hotheaded and proud CEO, Gen. Donald Lundee, an ex-Marine who took his war with the renegade Japanese security Corporation very personally. Currently, even as it labors under controls from Washington D.C. as a nationalized Corporate asset of the New United States, MTI is secretly rebuilding back to its former role as a combination of arms merchant and mercenary army. Even though greatly reduced by wartime losses, MTI is still the world's largest producer and seller of all manner of military weapons. From revolvers to tanks to jet fighters, MTI is a major military supplier to the re-uniting New United States. The New United States, in turn, is MTI's largest customer. But MTI will deal worldwide with anyone who has money, and its mercenary forces and in-house weaponry still make it the most militarily powerful company in the world, if not economically. 273 THE TIME OF THE RED Discussion of Militech can't be complete without talking about its primary leader during the 4th Corporate War. General Donald Lundee retired from the USMC as the Collapse was just beginning, helping to reorganize Armatech/Luccessi into the Militech Arms company. Since then, he remains CEO and one of the most, if not the most, influential persons on the Board of Directors. Although he doesn't own enough stock to control the Corporation, his force of personality, allies, and success record have kept him on top despite internal struggles. Lundee is also half of the equation that culminated in the 4th Corporate War. Over the years, he'd set himself and Militech up against Arasaka so often and for so long that he became personally involved, making it a matter of pride to defeat the Japanese and their attempt to take over the global arms market (because he already intended to do so). Not an easy man to get along with, his closest confidant is his second-in-command, ex-Marine Corps General Samantha Lee Young. Possessed of a fiery temper, Lundee's made more enemies than friends. And it's that same temper and arrogance that resulted in a dogged determination to see the war through to the bitter end, only brought to heel by President Kress' reactivation of his commission, and her command to cease hostilities. Lundee's convinced that he was a good general—in truth, he's not bad—and that if Kress hadn't interfered, he would have won his war. Even though his mercurial temper and impulsiveness resulted in some defeats for Militech (like the opening assault on the Osaka Arms Works) and plenty of headaches for his top soldiers, he's still capable of mustering the troops and putting an enemy to the sword if need be. ▶ Face: General Samantha Lee \"Sammy Lee\" Young ◀ Tall, confident, and possessing an imposing military bearing to go with the rank, Marine General Samantha Lee Young (ret.), was an up-and-coming military strategist and brilliant tactical general when she was talked into resigning her commission and going to work for General Donald Lundee. Multiple victories in the grueling combat environment of the SouthAm Wars had already earned her troops'—whom she often led from the front—undying loyalty and the nickname \"Sammy Slaughter Lee.\" So, she was a natural to lead Militech's most elite forces against the armies of their rival, the Arasaka Corporation. Up until President Elizabeth Kress—a fellow soldier in the past—pulled Militech's leash and forced an end to the War, Sammy Lee's tactical foresight was starting to fold Arasaka into a defensive posture. And while Kress didn't reactivate Young's commission, the two experienced warriors soon reached a peaceful understanding that awarded each other the highest respect. Even in her sixties, General Young is still a force to be reckoned with. Her impeccably maintained cyberware, long silver hair, and ramrod military posture positively reek of experience and expert command. She never loses her temper, unlike her superior Gen. Lundee—she responds to most provocations with a wry smile and a dismissive chuckle. But although few talk about it now, many survivors of the SouthAm still recall the Sammy Slaughter Lee who once led her division into the rebel stronghold known as \"The Hellmouth,\" and brought them back victorious. She's definitely more than just a \"Face\"—she's an unstoppable force. i know i'm A i know i'm A soldiersoldier. but As A solDieR, i know thAt . but As A solDieR, i know thAt eveRy time you Go to wAR; eveRy time you PiCk uP thAt eveRy time you Go to wAR; eveRy time you PiCk uP thAt Gun, theRe's A Gun, theRe's A priCepriCe to PAy. i've GRown to ACCePt to PAy. i've GRown to ACCePt thAt PRiCe, but i still ACCePt it with thAt PRiCe, but i still ACCePt it with reservationsreservations. . beCAuse AFteR the southAm, i'm All too AwARe beCAuse AFteR the southAm, i'm All too AwARe thAt in the enD, no one ReAlly thAt in the enD, no one ReAlly winswins A wAR.

Accordingly, no matter where you go in the country, Network News 54 is on Channel 54, although since the War their reach into the broadcast markets has been severely curtailed. Despite its name, News 54 offers many diversions in addition to news. Every regional office offers a slightly different schedule to its district, with syn- dicated series, non-prime-time movies, and independent local news programs. Certain elements of the broadcasting are universal nationwide, such as prime-time series and bi-hourly national and world news shows. Under the control of Michelle Dreyer, widow of the original founder, the actual Corporate offices are located on the vast prairie spread at Fifty Pines Ranch near Santa Fe, New Mexico. ▶ Face: Michelle Dreyer ◀ When her long-time and much-beloved husband, Edwin, passed away, the disconso- late Michelle swore she would keep her sweetheart's dream of a media empire alive. However, since she wasn't getting any younger, Michelle took out an insurance policy to make sure she would be around to shepherd Edwin's legacy. Over the years, first with moderate cyber repairs and later more extensive cybernetic enhancements needed to hold off the ravages of aging, Michelle has by now almost entirely replaced her original body with a perfectly designed Gemini full-body conversion, fixing her apparent age at her mid-fifties. But Michelle is still uncomfortable with her augmentations. After all, she's a good, God-fearing woman from Albuquerque, where people don't hold with messing with the Almighty's Plan.

Worlds' largest CHOOH 2 producer Headquarters: Dallas, Free State of Texas Regional Offices: New York, Washington, Miami, Chicago, San Francisco, Tokyo, London, Hamburg, Paris, Rome. Oil fields in Many Canadian Territories, Texas, Alaska, California, and Antarctica. Agricultural areas in California and the Midwest and Southeast Chief Officer: Angus Youngblood Employees: 338,000 ▶ Background ◀ It was nicknamed \"The AV Gas War\" by the press during the conflict, but it's also been dubbed \"the war within the war.\" Early in the 4th Corp War, Militech and Arasaka simultaneously realized that they were headed for a major clash, and began squirreling away ever more fuel to prepare. Then both Petrochem and SovOil cheerfully sold these Corporations almost their entire reserves of aviation fuel, realizing that doing so would cause the appearance of a shortage and allow them to adopt massive price increases with impunity. However, even with this unexpected windfall, Petrochem had its own problems to worry about with its far-flung assets vulnerable to attack. This resulted in a general mobilization of Petrochem's military assets. Some press outlets even noted that the American Midwest in this time became the most peaceful in decades, thanks to the preponderance of Petrochem security forces nervously patrolling the area. In the end, although they were never directly involved in the 4th Corp War, the need to protect their valuable wells and fields—as well as fight off sporadic SovOil attacks as opportunities presented themselves—drew so heavily on Petrochem that it entered the post-War period seriously depleted. With the collapse of most multinational fuel companies after the 4th Corp War, Petrochem is keeping the world running. Literally. They're the world's largest producer of CHOOH 2 (under license), and control millions of acres of arable land across the un-incorporated United States—land chiefly used to grow the genetically altered wheat that is used to make the synthetic fuel known as CHOOH 2. Petrochem is also one of the world's largest oil producers, but with the oil supply dwindling most remaining fossil fuels are used to make plastics and other synthetics. Petrochem also has more fertile oil fields than any other company. All of these assets are huge, and accordingly hard to protect from other companies that would like to usurp Petrochem's wealth. With such vast interests to protect—and due to recent loses to Continental Brands—Petrochem has invested huge amounts of money in protecting itself, maintaining an armed force worthy of a small country. Still chafing under its CHOOH 2 license from Biotechnica, it's only a matter of time before Petrochem's wily CEO finds a way to absorb the smaller biotech company for good. ▶ Face: Angus Youngblood ◀ Before the War, Angus Youngblood was a rich, young Australian investor who became a major shareholder in Petrochem in 2013, when the company bought CHOOH 2-growing land from his family's huge agricultural holdings in New South Wales. Once the third most powerful member of the Petrochem board, the devious Youngblood used his support of the aging Board Chairman Ellen Trieste as a tool towards his plan to take over the vast fuel empire. Youngblood used Trieste's infatuation with him to talk her into a marriage of convenience, combining his stock with hers to form a large controlling interest. Now that Ellen is dead, he no longer must cater to her romantic fantasies, as unwanted as he once found them. 276 THE TIME OF THE RED Always suave, witty, and stylish, Youngblood is still handsome and healthy in his later years, sporting an air of competence and control. He's well known for his wit and casual bonhomie; a front that has served him well by disarming many of his worst rivals, including his ambitious younger brother Malcolm. But make no mistake about it, Angus Youngblood is as shrewd and as ruthless as ever and has no qualms when it comes to mercilessly disposing of his enemies. Angus particularly loathes Olivia Forsythe, for her role in stealing billions of dollars of intellectual and physical property from Petrochem under his watch. RoCklin AuGmentiCs American cybernetics and structural enhancements specialists Headquarters: Austin, Free State of Texas Regional Offices: Washington D.C., Chicago, Denver, Atlanta, Baltimore, Seattle, Dallas, Night City Chief Officer/Designer: Jacinda Hidalgo Employees: 125,000 ▶ Background ◀ Founded in 2004 by Andrew Rocklin, Rocklin Prosthetics was a major supplier of arti- ficial limb technology to the Veterans Administration after the Central American Police Actions. But as prosthetic devices evolved from simple medical aids to full cybernetic enhancements, Rocklin found itself eclipsed by more aggressive Cybercorps like Dynalar and Kiroshi. While the Corp eked out an existence through their old government con- tracts, they found their sturdy but basic products falling out of favor in the hyper-charged markets of the Cyberpunk Age. Then, like a phoenix rising from the ashes, Rocklin was radically reborn in 2030 as Rocklin Augmentics. Now led by Andrew's daughter, Jacinda Hidalgo, the Neocorp burst onto the scene with an entirely new catalog of enhancements: bleeding edge designs that emphasized their artificial qualities and unique aesthetics. Still boasting the Rocklin repu- tation for reliability and strength, these new enhancements refused all pretense at organic simulation with open frameworks, bizarre color schemes, and proportions and variations that seemed brazenly inhuman. Public response was immediate and enthusiastic. Hidalgo followed up with her \"Signature Cybernetics Series,\" each created by a popular artist, from street calligrapher Visser with her daring post-human-punk aesthetic, to the Art Nouveau-inspired stylings of Hamilton Welch. Rocklin still offers a selection of good-quality, domestically-made cybernetics in more conventional styles, albeit with greater sophistication than before, but it's Rocklin's more outré lines that are burning up the Data Terms, and Hidalgo keeps pouring CHOOH 2 on the flames. RA has grown like a Siamese fighting fish since then, with new facilities in several New U.S. and Free State cities, and has garnered a sizable portion of the domestic augmentations field, focusing on cyberlimb and skeletal enhancement systems.

Local Corps often need to hire freelancers since they can't front regular talent; you can easily set up \"temp jobs\" connected to a local Corp right from the start of play (Arasaka isn't going to be hiring the Characters until they show their mettle at the local level and work their way up so they catch the notice of the larger Corps.). Also, local Corps are more likely to hire and pay the Characters with the promise of stock or own- ership (they usually don't have a lot of cash hanging around) which can be a great plot hook and gives Characters incentive to keep them around and help them grow. Who knows; the PCs in your game may even end up running their own local Corp! 277 THE TIME OF THE RED no overseas manufacturing operations; Rocklin has proclaimed itself an American company first and foremost, even as the term ‘American' is being rapidly redefined. They employ a lot of people displaced during the Time of The Red and enjoy a strong populist reputation with the public. Still, controversy erupted in 2041 when an independent Media, Duel Murata, posted interviews with two of Rocklin's former designers who claimed that they were instructed to sign their names to prototypes that they were handed by management; baroque designs that implied the possibility of a \"cyberware gestalt,\" uniting augmentations from multiple individuals. They cited the work as truly next level and possibly a violation of the AI Protocols. Netwatch quickly stepped in, determined to ferret out any illegal AI experiments. But despite a thorough sweep of all Rocklin facilities, including a Warrant Watchdog on all intercompany data traffic, no charges have been filed as of this date. Naturally, Rocklin responded with a new advertising campaign: \"Rock Aug! Cyberware for Humans, by Humans!\" Rocklin has since filed suits against both the designers for slander and violation of their NDAs, despite the fact that one of them has been missing for almost two months now. ▶ Face: Jacinda Hidalgo ◀ Jacinda Hidalgo lost both her legs to a landmine in Costa Rica at age 10. It was while she was getting a set of cyberlegs at the Rocklin clinic in Dallas that her mother, Leticia, met Andrew Rocklin. They married two years later, with Jacinda adopted as Andrew's legal heir. She became known as something of a wunderkind around the Rocklin offices and soon attended the Texas Institute of Technology, graduating with honors in 2022. Unfortunately, Andrew Rocklin disappeared in 2023, the rumor being that he died during the War (or flew off to Mars; post-DataKrash records vary). Jacinda took control of the Corporation at the age of 26, and quickly applied her energy and vision to remake Rocklin into a company that could compete in the brutal post-Corporate War market. She held true to her father's tenets of strength and durability, while bringing her own unique sense of artistry to the tech. Now 42, Jacinda still has the face of a young woman, but much of the rest of her body has been made into a display case for Rocklin products. The exact extent of her augmentation is unknown, although she was recently seen sporting a Hamilton Welch cyberarm in addition to her matching cyberlegs, and extensive endostructural enhancements seem likely. She changes cyberlimbs like evening dresses, often displaying her company's cre- ations with acrobatics that would be the envy of trained martial artists. Co-workers describe her as intensively creative and driven, with a no-nonsense, direct management style and take-no-prisoners competitive attitude. Her enemies have given her the nickname ‘The War Orphan' to which Hidalgo has responded, \"They don't know what war is. But they will.\" sovoil Petrochemical products and agribusiness Headquarters: Moscow, Russia Regional Offices: Toshkent, St. Petersburg, Tokyo, Seoul, Beijing, Manila, Ho Chi Min City, Havana, Night City Chief Officers: Central Committee (actual membership unknown) Employees: 245,000 278 THE TIME OF THE RED ▶ Background ◀ By 1997, the Neo-Soviets had the capacity to recover only a fraction of the vast fields of oil lying under their federation. After a massive program of expansion and modernization, KeroSov, the previous state-run oil industry, became strong enough to break away from the oligarchs of the Federal Central Committee and become the Neo-Sovetskiy Neftyanoy Kombinat (Neo-Soviet Oil Combine aka SovOil). Now sitting on top of the world's largest remaining oil reservoirs, SovOil's oligarch leaders know that the oil won't flow forever. But they're still a wealthy and powerful Corporation, with unmatched access to an incredibly valuable commodity, plus a variety of other products and industries. Unfortunately for them, developments like Biotechnica's CHOOH 2 have rapidly undermined their strategic dominance. In the mid-2010s SovOil and Petrochem fell into a disagreement over territories in the South China Sea, leading to a short, but savage, war that grievously wounded both Corporations. The result was that Petrochem decided to concentrate its efforts towards emerging CHOOH 2 fuel technology, while SovOil was forced to dedicate its own to exploring the untapped oilfields of the long untouched Siberian region. But both sides knew that they would eventually meet again in a final match-up. The 4th Corporate War has only delayed that reckoning. SovOil's Central Committee is already moving the pieces around in their long game, making plans that will carry the company into the next step of its evolution, when oil is no longer their prime source of income. The first step toward ensuring the company's survival is diversification. SovOil is the major economic force in the Neo-Soviet Union and much of Eastern Europe, and the company has a guaranteed market share in these areas. The more services and goods SovOil can provide the people of these regions, the better off the company will be when the oil runs out. SovOil is already active in mining, shipbuilding, research, and CHOOH 2 agriculture. It's just beginning to move into aircraft, computers, synthetics, CHOOH 2 power systems, and general agriculture. By 2050, the board hopes to have a product base diverse enough to fight the coming war with their Petrochem rivals, who have yet to fully recover from the chaos of the last Corporate War. ▶ Face: Anatoly Novaragov ◀ Large, loud, and ostentatious, Anatoly looks exactly like the Western idea of a Russian oli- garch. He wears bright and expensive shirts open to the navel, drapes himself in gold jewelry, and favors expensive cars, strong alcohol, and beautiful women. But those who know him well recall an earlier Anatoly: a rather faceless bureaucrat who used to wear shabby suits and scrupulously horded his money to the point of miserliness. This has a lot of important people wondering, is this the real Anatoly Novaragov going through a midlife crisis? Is this a clever ruse put on by the Central Committee to distract its Petrochem enemies? Or could it be an actor taking the place of a Novaragov long ago buried behind the dacha of a powerful political rival on the Committee itself? No one knows, and no one's talking. Even Anatoly's ex-wife, Irina, has been quiet on the subject, although a astronomically generous divorce settlement may have had a lot to do with her reticence. What hasn't changed about the current Anatoly Novaragov (whatever his provenance) is his reputation for ruthlessness. Even before he took on his peacock finery, he was well known as a cunning operator who leveraged a number of connections with the old KGB and the fearsome Bratva (Russian mafia) to make enemies and rivals disappear without a trace. Or to sometimes resurface months later as collections of unidentifiable body parts liberally strewn in parks all over his native city of St. Petersburg. Don't let the flashy side of SovOil's \"Face\" fool you; he can play nasty with the best of them. 279 THE TIME OF THE RED tRAumA teAm Ambulance and paramedic services Headquarters: Seattle, Washington Regional Offices: Most Major North American Cities Chief Officers: Carrie Lachanan and Bob Jones Employees: 15,000 ▶ Background ◀ Still one of the largest private medical firms in the world, Trauma Team provides ambulance services and paramedic support for a client base of at least fifteen million people. Equipped with top-line AV type vehicles, Trauma Teams provide an essential service in the 2000s: recovering wounded clients from the field. Dispersed as needed among the offices are 1,305 AV-4 aerodyne vehicles, thirty Corporate jets, twenty-two Osprey II aircraft, and four C-29 heavy cargo jets. Each franchise office also has its own surgical-capable infirmary and arrangements with local hospitals for high-need patients. During the War, Trauma Team International became even busier than ever and the company's capabilities were stretched to the limit. To keep the number of cases down (and to preserve its neutrality) Trauma Team declared that they wouldn't respond to any alert from a member of Arasaka or Militech. They just couldn't to be honest: one battle would tie up every TT team in an entire city otherwise. Instead, TT would only respond to civilian requests, and they'd be charging the combat rate if anyone so much as fired a weapon within half a kilometer. Even with those extra costs, TT was swamped with calls after every Militech/Arasaka clash. Trauma Team survived the 4 th Corporate War but only as regional providers. The conflict not only drew heavily upon their limited resources, but also upon their suppliers. Repair parts for their fleet of AV-4s and jets are hard to come by, as well as medical dressings, key drugs and vaccines, and even trained personnel. With the War's end came another problem, as hospitals and clinics collapsed, throwing ever more desperately ill or wounded patients onto the Trauma Team rolls. Not all of these patients can afford TT's high response fees, but groups of Edgerunners have been known to chip in to buy a single card that they break to call in the Trauma Team in the hopes that the TT paramedics will at least patch the rest of the team up. The War has also changed TT's Corporate look as well: in the past, their crisp blue and yellow uniforms were a comforting sign of their competence and capability. But endless street battles and the availability of surplus military hardware has forced the Trauma Team to armor up almost as heavily as the worst Psycho Squad. The uniforms are still blue, but the new helmets are mil-spec, heavy duty combat rigs, coupled with heavy armor, power armor support systems (yellow), and self-contained combat medipacs. This coupled with the lack of qualified Medtechs, has given Trauma Team a new face: harried, overworked, angry, and impatient. ▶ Faces: Carrie Lachanan and Bob Jones ◀ Trauma Team is unusual in that it has two Faces, each representing a differ- ent area of the Company. Although both Lachanan and Jones are top rated Doctors/Medtechs, Lachanan specializes in the day-to-day operations of the company and its franchises, while Jones covers the manpower and materiel side of the equation. Both, over many years of marriage (each maintains their original name as they married while both worked together in the early days of the company) have become mirrors of each other: weary, fed up, no-nonsense medics who put their patients first. Because the current rules of Corporations require that they present a \"Face,\" they put up with the formalities, but it takes a major act of persuasion to drag them into any Corporate hearing or event. 280 THE TIME OF THE RED ZiGGuRAt The backbone of modern communications and data infrastructure Headquarters: Night City Regional Offices: Most North American Cities Chief Officer: UR (Pronounced You Are) Employees: 115,000 ▶ Background ◀ Ziggurat seemingly appeared from nowhere in 2030 in Night City with a plan to transform the old fiber-optic Data Term network into a new system and restore cheap and reliable communication across the whole of the metroplex. With a grant from Night Corp and buy-in from the fractious City Council, the brand-new CitiNet was up and operational within months. Ziggurat further increased usability by overlaying the CitiNet with the first Data Pool, an open protocol for displaying and sharing data that anyone could use. Ziggurat quickly spread out from Night City to other metroplexes in North America, repeating the process. By 2040, most cities in the New United States, the Pacifica Confed, Canada, and the Free States had CitiNets and Data Pools courtesy of the company. Ziggurat also helped restore communication between metropolitan regions by providing simple and inexpensive city-to-city communication via hourly data-packet burst transfers along a cobbled together patchwork of reclaimed phone lines, free-space optics, and even Nomad couriers. This long-distance communication only works via text, voice, and video messages. Direct audio and visual contact still requires a contract with the more expensive WorldSat Comm Network. Almost immediately after the Night City Data Pool went online, Ziggurat published the first set of apps to make use of it. This allowed them to not only collect fees from the government for setting up and maintaining CitiNets and Data Pools but monetized their use by collecting and selling data, selling advertising space, and supplying users with in-app upgrades. Among Ziggurat's most popular app offerings are the Ask Alex Anything pseudo-AI data crawler, the BabelChat chat app, the ZPost electronic mail service, and the Ziggurat Editing Suite for text, audio, video, and app creation. While there are minor competitors, most content on North American Data Pools is created using Ziggurat Apps and consumed via the Garden, the company's one-stop platform for sharing content. Any Garden user can, at no cost, set up their own Garden Patch, a space on the Data Pool made specifically for sharing their text, audio, virtual, and braindance creations. Patches can be customized using a limited variety of free overlays or more functional—and thus more expensive—templates. Once setup is completed, users can populate their Patch with text, still imagery, audio and video, virtual, and braindance creations that other users can consume and comment on. Ziggurat runs targeted advertisements before, after, and during Garden content, cutting the creators in for ten percent of revenues. Most modern PopMedia stars in the Time of the Red get their start on the Garden and most performers and companies, no matter how big, maintain their own Patch in order to reach the broadest possible audience with their entertainment, commercials, and products. In 2043, Ziggurat opened offices in London and Melbourne with the intent of penetrating the European and Australian markets but has met stiff—and often armed—resistance from local competitors. 281 THE TIME OF THE RED ▶ Face: UR ◀ The founder and visionary behind Ziggurat, UR (pronounced You Are), represents the can do, by the bootstrap spirit of the modern Corp Executive. Little is known about them from before they burst onto the scene in 2030 with an ambitious plan to rebuild communications in the Time of the Red. Extremely charismatic, UR's ambition and enthusiasm united a normally heavily divided Night City Council long enough to build one of the first CitiNets and Data Pools in the world. UR regularly publishes their thoughts and ideas in the form of video journals on their Garden Patch and constantly seeks to redefine themself. Over the last two and a half decades, they've chased several fad diets and promoted a broad selection of life philosophies. UR has also explored multiple spiritualities, including a brief but controversial stint spent as a member of a small but intense religion that worships a long-dead Rockerboy, known as the Church of Elvis. One thing that has remained consistent no matter what trend UR chases is their enthusiasm for bodysculpting. Since 2030, UR has undergone at least three transformations, from a typical tech to a young-Elvis-inspired look, to their current elegant appearance. Most recently, they began adding elements of Exotic sculpting. Rather than undergo complete overhauls, UR changes appearance gradually, tweaking eye color here or lip shape there until they arrive at a fully different form. It has become something of a game for UR's fans to compare the Executive's current appearance in their latest video journal to their last one to discover what the latest tweak is. Rumors about UR abound but few can be confirmed. Despite regularly recording and releasing video journals, they rarely give away much about their private lives to the public. Those who make a habit of watching UR's video journals have noticed one possible bit of personal information: UR regularly mentions the infamous Rache Bartmoss in a way that indicates the founder of Ziggurat either has, or believes they have, a personal connection to the renegade Netrunner. However, given the volume of misinformation surrounding Bartmoss, this clue provides little insight into UR's life before the Time of the Red. ZhiRAFA teChniCAl mAnuFACtuRinG Manufacturer of drone, autonomous robotics, and construction mecha Headquarters: Vladivostok, Russia Regional Offices: London, Paris, Tel Aviv, Mumbai, Singapore, Night City Chief Officer: Artyom Sokolov Employees: 225,000 ▶ Background ◀ In the wake of the 4th Corporate War, the Neo-Soviet Union was weakened by antiquated technology and an unstable economy based almost entirely on fossil fuels. The major economic power of the nation, SovOil, had managed to make a killing in the last Corporate War but everyone was painfully aware that sooner or later the oil would run out or CHOOH 2 would finally make fossil fuels obsolete and the Neo-Soviet economy would come crashing down. Where many other countries used technology to aid in their recovery and shore up their economies, Russia's ability to compete in the international tech market was still extremely limited. Russia's few technical exports weren't going far and were largely recognized by the rest of the world as poor-quality garbage. 282 THE TIME OF THE RED This changed in 2039, when a street tech from Moscow brought the GRAF3 to the market. This new construction robot entered the market at a reasonable price point and proved itself to be durable and easily repairable. But most importantly, the GRAF3 was perfect for cleaning up the remaining destruction of the War. It was cheap enough to be bought by local governments in bulk, and small communities could buy one and be sure it would last them years. In the chaotic post-War atmosphere, there weren't many people who questioned how Zhirafa got founded or how it spread its influence so far across Russia so quickly after developing their first project. Officially, Zhirafa was founded by its CEO, Artyom Sokolov, with a few of his Edgerunner friends and a healthy savings built on mercenary work during the War, but rumors persist that the meteoric rise of Zhirafa can be attributed to the activity of the Bratva criminal syndicate and their groups of allied Russian Nomads. After breaking into the market with the giraffe-like GRAF3, the Corporation went on to rocket Russian tech to new heights with the release of several lines of drones and robots built for variable tasks. Besides the GRAF Line, the most notable and ubiquitous development of Zhirafa is the Savanna Line, a line of aerial and terrestrial combat drones for use by security and law enforcement. By the year 2045, many governments and Corporations across the world use Savanna Eagle and Savanna Panther Drones for security and law enforcement. ▶ Face: Artyom Sokolov ◀ The Founder and CEO of Zhirafa is an ex-Edgerunner named Artyom Sokolov. Zhirafa is quick to mention that Artyom is a self-made man who grew up in a grubby arcology in the heart of the Neo-Soviet Union and his mission statement is to spread affordable technology to the masses and push technological development forward no matter what. They're less upfront about his history on The Street, focusing on his most daring exploits and omitting his time spent as a Corporate soldier protecting SovOil assets in Africa, and the messy nature of his defection. Artyom is a volatile, charismatic figure who maintains a relaxed, simple streetwear style accented by extrava- gant, custom cyberware that could pay an Edgerunner's rent 'til 2077. Artyom is often cited as being off-putting and unprofessional by rival tech companies due to his casual approach to business and his eccentric life. In the office, Artyom is known for rarely taking anything too seriously. Advertisements greenlit by Artyom are casual and honest, often lamp-shading the techniques of other Corporations. When faced with opposition, Artyom has earned a reputation for humiliating challengers with blackmail and humorously doctored photos. And of course, the subsequent disappearance of any particularly stubborn opposition has never been linked to Zhirafa or Artyom. In his personal life, Artyom runs in eccentric circles, hosting parties in starscrapers with the glitterati and known Bratva members and sponsoring bizarre and often radical artists and musicians. However, despite his strange and lavish lifestyle, fans of Zhirafa are always quick to point to the many inter- views Artyom has given on the trajectory of Zhirafa and the future of robotics. In these interviews it's easy to see the glint of inspiration in Artyom's gold-plated cyberoptics even if it may be difficult from time-to-time to keep up with the technical jargon he runs through in his almost stream of consciousness style. It's hard, even for Artyom's detractors, to argue that the man isn't a driven tech with a complex understanding of robotics and technology. so, welCome to the so, welCome to the time of the redtime of the red, ChoombA. it's , ChoombA. it's moRe DAnGeRous thAn the onCe GlAmoRous AnD hyPeR-moRe DAnGeRous thAn the onCe GlAmoRous AnD hyPeR- ChARGeD lost AGe oF the ChARGeD lost AGe oF the Cyberpunk 2020sCyberpunk 2020s. the . the boDy Count is boDy Count is higherhigher AnD the stAkes even AnD the stAkes even nastiernastier. but . but thAt's not GoinG to thAt's not GoinG to stopstop you, is it?

Not sure what, but they're somethin'. It's like livin' in a hurricane. You go with the flow and see where the storm takes you. Just try not to get ripped up on the way.\" Green Thumb 284 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY A Bit of Night City History Today, Night City is healing from the ravages of the last tumultuous decades. But it should never be for- gotten that like most of America, Night City, is still an armed society under a blanket of appalling poverty, violence, and inequity. It's not uncommon to see as many guns as briefcases on the crowded City streets; and while the worst days of chaos may be over, the danger still remains—society's rule collapsed before and may yet do so again. History can repeat itself, and there's always another gang just around the corner, waiting for its chance to come out on top, no matter what the cost. This was the bitter lesson America was learning at the end of the 20th century. After the Collapse, many Megacorps began looking to establish their own urban areas: controlled cities free of crime, poverty, and debt. City govern- ments would be Corporate-run, allowing optimum zoning and no anti-business elements to interfere with Corporate growth. But the right combination of business savvy and city engineering prowess was only a distant hope, until Richard Night came on the scene. A mAn with A DReAm Born in Pasadena, California, Richard Night was the second of five children. His parents were both researchers at Caltech, specializing in materials science. Night showed an aptitude for engineering at a relatively early age, but when a joint venture with his college roommate (noted business tycoon Romney Zukarian) turned sour, the angry Night shifted his major from engineering to business financial invest- ment. Armed with his new knowledge of the ins and outs of business, Night soon regained his company from his old rival. Applying his backgrounds in engineering and investment, Night soon founded Halsey, Ferris, and Night, a development company specializing in using advanced construction techniques to build massive mega-projects such as office complexes, airports, and even small cities. HFN was wildly successful in the years before the Collapse, leading to the construction of many large model communities around the world. niGht & the sPeCtRe oF the CollAPse Concerned by the violence and disruption of the impending Collapse, Night decided that he was uniquely situated to deal with the problem. Starting a side company (Night Industries) to protect his part- ners, Night began to plan a new city—an environment that would be controlled and ultimately safe from the ravages tearing the world apart. His new city would be completely planned, self-sufficient, and capable of holding off even the most determined marauders. It would boast planned neighborhoods dedicated to preserving the feel of different types of nationalities and cultures, as well as a super-modern Corporate Center that would stand as a shining beacon of enlightened capitalism. It was ambitious, far-reaching, and visionary in its approach. The only problem was where to put it. Night was going to need a lot of land for his new city devel- opment, as well as access to both ocean ports and modern highways to deliver the huge amount of materials that he would need to construct it. He sent scouting teams to scour the East and West Coasts of the besieged United States, but in the end it was a small article in the San Francisco Chronicle that caught BY MAREK MADEJ 285 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY his eye: an article describing an incident of post-ho- locaust horror that had taken place in a small town along the Central California coast. the moRRo bAy mAssACRe Throughout the last decades of the 20th century, Morro Bay and San Luis Obispo had suffered a long history with the Hell's Angels and other local go/biker gangs (a gogang is a cyber-enhanced biker gang), mostly because there was very little law enforcement on the fringes of the California Coast and the area was also a hub for two major highways (Highway 1 and U.S. 101). During the Collapse, San Luis law enforcement and the Hell's Angels legacy booster- gangs began a turf war that spilled over to Morro Bay. The Boosters took over the town in a five-day rampage that ended with many of the 10,000 people who lived there either dead, maimed, or fleeing the tiny town (there were only about 4,000 families there to begin with). The entire area became a ghost town that no one wanted to go back to, known to all as the site of the infamous Morro Bay Massacre. the CoRonADo City PARtneRshiP Based on its dark history, maverick developer Richard Night was able to buy the remnants of the ghost town of Morro Bay for pennies on the dollar. He was aided by Petrochem, who had taken over the now-abandoned Dynergy power plant and was already planning to set up an offshore port and oil terminal site. Bankrolled by Merrill, Asukaga & Finch (who wanted to make the new city a financial hub) Night and Petrochem hired Arasaka to clean out the boostergangs and make the place \"safe\" again. Further funds came from external (and somewhat shady) investors lured to the project by the promise of lucrative building contracts and possible sources of extralegal income. To avoid the stigma of the Morro Bay Massacre, the Partnership renamed the area Del Coronado Bay, the site of their new city of Coronado. However, thanks to the rather out-sized personality of its founder, Coronado City soon became colloquially known by locals as \"Night's City.\"MORRO BAY AREA CIRCA 1990TRANSITION FROM 1990 TO 2020 286 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY City Center and the Corporate Center were, of course, glittering zones of high-rises and corporate parks. It was here that Night showed off his personal architectural skills in the designs of the many corpo- rate \"starscrapers\" that were the most visible sign of Coronado City's rising affluence. Night's vision was indeed expansive and truly visionary. The only catch came when he started to build it. the mob moves in Although Petrochem and MA&F were the major bank- rollers for the Coronado Partnership, they had one dis- advantage: they weren't construction companies. For a job like Coronado City, the Partnership was going to need someone who could bring in the machines and workforce to actually dig the holes and put up the steel. They ended up with the Mob. the FAll oF niGht City The West Coast Mobs (Mafia, Yakuza, etc, etc.) had maintained a stranglehold on heavy construction on the \"left coast\" for decades. They controlled the construction unions, the transport unions, and most of the governmental agencies in charge of construction licenses, environmental impacts, and other building necessities. By investing a not inconsiderable sum in the Partnership (through a series of shell corpora- tions), the Mobs hoped to not only make a staggering amount of return on lucrative construction work, but also have the inside track on future gambling, prosti- tution, and drug franchises in the new city. But Night's visionary plan required using his own advanced building techniques and materials, exclud- ing a number of established unions and construction firms controlled by his organized crime partners. This didn't make them happy, and Night's further insis- tence that his new city would be safe and crime free angered them even more. During the first four years of construction, there were daily threats against Night's life. A proud and self-reliant man, he typically ignored them. When the threats escalated to the level of sabo- tage and intimidation, he called in his Corporate allies, who dealt with the threats in a ruthless, but limited, the RebuilDinG oF moRRo bAy Coronado City needed more room than was in the original geology of the Bay, so Night leveled the surrounding hills and dumped them into the ocean as fill (just as San Francisco had done years ago for the 1939 World's Fair). He reshaped the bay so that the formerly narrow sand spit to the west was widened to about 10 miles. He also re-dredged the harbor making it capable of porting the large ships needed to build the city; this dirt also ended up as fill on the western edge. A City oF neiGhboRhooDs Coronado City truly reflected its creator's eclectic vision. Instead of a huge construction of steel and glass, Night's urban plan broke the new city into a series of neighborhoods, each with a different architectural style and theme, much like the original Disneyland park's various \"lands\" (e.g. Frontierland, Tomorrowland, Adventureland, New Orleans Square, and Fantasyland). A faux east coast neighborhood (Upper Eastside and Little Italy) encompassed elements of Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, while Studio City and Charter Hill reflected the western styles of Seattle and San Francisco. Lake Park, Westhill Gardens, and the University District were primarily set aside as comfortable urban living spaces, ranging from faux brownstones to pseudo-Victorian gingerbread homes, interspersed with plenty of small shops, restaurants, and businesses within easy walking distance. New Harbor and the East Marina were designated as the site of a world-class mall, equivalent to San Francisco's tony Galleria with an open Marina area that could handle yachts, cruise ships, and other recreational boating activities (the main industrial port would be established north of the city in North Oak.) Even the Asian districts (Little China and Japantown) were distinctly different, reflecting the individual cultural styles of each area, as well as a smattering of other Southeast Asian locales in the Eastpark area adjacent to Japantown. In addition, Night also paid homage to the late and lamented small hamlet of Morro Bay by recreating much of the original layout of the area in a small-town, open-air environment reminiscent of a seaside village called Old Downtown. 287 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY manner. Finally, Night's luck ran out. On September 20th, 1998, he was shot and killed in his penthouse suite at the top of the newly constructed Parkview Tower. Night's killer was never apprehended. In his memory, the newly appointed City Council officially renamed Coronado City \"Night City.\" mob Rule Four years after initial construction, powerful gang bosses murdered Night and took over the Coronado City project. By 2005, the Mob had become the king of the hill. The Corporations established their strongholds in the outlying \"Beavervilles\" and their lofty Corporate Plaza fortresses. They had little or no interest in running the City, and the civic leaders were unable to lead without Corporate masters to pull the strings and provide the muscle. Organized crime may be great at being organized to do crimes, but it's not as good at running a city. Within a year of opening, Coronado City's city government was replaced by corrupt Mob-selected puppets and even Petrochem and MA&F found themselves shoved aside in the rush to make the quick illegal Eurobucks. Between selling contracts to their cronies, setting up drug and extortion rackets, and generally inviting the scum of the Collapse into the area, the mobs managed to turn a relatively clean, modern city into an embat- tled war zone. Crime, drugs, prostitution, random violence, and cybernetic terrorism soon became the rule of law. By 2009, the name Night City had taken on a grim and deadly new meaning. These years were the \"dark ages\" of Night City, with more murders in that four-year span than there were for most cities in ten. The Mob ruled the city with an iron fist, killing anything in its way. Gang activity was at an all-time high during this period, with notorious gangs like the Blood Razors and the Slaughterhouse making their debut. Night City soon became the closest thing to hell on earth: a war zone where you were just as likely to have your car blown up as have its radio stolen. The number of unsolved murders documented by the police rose into the thousands. the meGACoRPs tAke oveR After four years of street warfare, in 2009 the Corporations finally decided they'd had enough. From 2009-2011, during the period of conflict now called the Mob War, the Corporations battled the under- world for control of Night City. It must be understood that the Corporations didn't go to war over such lowly concerns as people or basic human decency. This was business. Like a rival Corporation, the Mob had its own goals, and these didn't fit into the Corporate agenda. If the Mob wouldn't play by the rules, the Corps could deal with them on the same level. Led by Arasaka-trained paramilitary troops in assault vehi- cles, fan tanks, and AV combat aerodynes, a wave of bombings, assassinations, and outright street battles descended upon the Mob's ill-prepared cadres. When the smoke cleared, the Corporations had utterly destroyed the Mob's power base in Night City. From then on, any time the Mob crossed one of the Corps, they made sure to do it by the rules of Big Business. At the end of the Mob War, the Corporations placed a puppet mayor in power and started cleaning up the City. The newly elected Council, faced with the return of chaos in Night City, deputized Corporate security forces and allowed them full authority within city limits. The Corporate and city centers were cleaned out and restored to their pristine state. The other neighborhoods were also cleaned out (some- times with varying levels of success) and made livable again. Marginally. The Corps' draconian policies contributed to the City's now chronic homeless problem; if you didn't have enough money to pay for the renovated version of the place you were living in, you were kicked out by force. This ultimately put hundreds on the street as affordable housing was upgraded and used to house the troops the Corporations needed to maintain order. In later years, this situation eased as fewer enforcers and security teams were needed to keep the streets safe. By 2013, much of the worst excesses of the City had been crushed under the ruthless heel of the Megacorps. The basic services such as Police, Fire, and support services had been reestablished, and if the Corporate masters were oppressive, at least to the average punk on The Street, it was better than dodging gunfire on the way to the Vendit booth. Mob is being used as a generic term here. A number of different criminal organizations are active in Night City, including the Mafia, the Triad, the Yakuza, and the Bratva. 288 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY N ight City in 2020 the golden age By 2020, Night City was a rapidly growing urban region, still rife with urban violence and street crime, but with strong economic growth in the Corporate sector. It was the quintessential city of the Cyberpunk future—gritty, dangerous, but possessing an urban slick and stylish cool that made it unique. As Bes Isis, Net 54 newscaster and one of Night City's most well-known public figures put it at the time: nobodynobody eveR leAves eveR leAves niGht City. exCePt niGht City. exCePt in A in A bodybody bagbag.. the \"DisneylAnD\" Zones Keeping with Richard Night's vision, Coronado City was divided into neigh- borhoods, each with a different archi- tectural style and theme, much like the original Disneyland park. Night hoped to bring in a vibrant multi-cultural popu- lation attracted to each neighborhood. But with his untimely death, Night's city disintegrated into a hodgepodge of competing districts, savaged by gangs, and later controlled by domineering Megacorporations. ▶ Little Asia ◀ Japantown: An exciting Japanese cul- tural center and link to the Pacific Rim. Little China: An old-style Chinatown with many fine restaurants and curio shops. ▶ Little Europe ◀ Little Italy: A traditional Italian neigh- borhood and stronghold of the colorful old Mafia Lords of Night City. Northside District: An aging industrial neighborhood designed to resemble Old New York, with many interesting inhabitants. Upper Marina: Blending architectural elements to resemble San Francisco's North Beach and Marina district. East Marina: The old industrial and pier area, partially gentrified. Home to the Ferry Building and the Marina Yacht Club. ▶ The Upscale Brownstones ◀ Old Downtown: The core of the orig- inal township of Morro Bay; a pictur- esque mesh of older slums and equally colorful boosters. West Hill: An elegant, self-contained community catering to the wealthy and powerful. ▶ City & Corporate District ◀ Corporate Center: Where the real power laid in Night City; home to the towering citadels of the real rulers of the City. City Center: A City governmental nexus and hub of the Megacorps and power dealers. See your taxes at work. Bank Block: The beating financial heart of the City, and source of the Corporate cash. Med Center: The largest concentration of medical-related businesses in the City. Also, home to Trauma Team and other knife artists. ▶ The Nightlife District ◀ New Harbor Area: Home of the Mallplex, a multi-level shopping plaza and mini-arcology, and its neighbor, McCartney Stadium, home of the Superbowl-winning California Rangers. why The hisTory Lesson? So, why are we giving you this lowdown on what Night City used to look like more than two decades ago? Simple: Cities are like layer cakes. Different eras of construction are often built right over the previous era (for example, there are so many levels of the legendary city of Troy that archaeologists have given the individual eras their own numbers; and did you know that Seattle has entire underground districts?) But like legendary Troy, buried parts of a City may hold all kinds of interesting and now lost treasures— weapons, money, data, etc. So, think of this section as the start of an archae- ological treasure map that may net your Players some really cool stuff if they're willing to dig. 289 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY Upper Eastside: A commercial and business zone with gang action and hot clubs. Studio City: Home to Colonial Studios, an old-time film studio. Charter Hill: Enjoy gambling in style in the luxurious Hacienda Hotel casino. ▶ The University District ◀ Night City University: An academic fortress and bastion of higher learning, supporting a lively counterculture. Lake Park: Bio-engineered plants and animals are only two of the attractions of this spacious central park. the subuRbAn sPRAwls As developed, there were six \"suburbs\" surround- ing metropolitan Night City: South Night City (an industrial port area), Pacifica (a beach city on the coast), Rancho Coronado (the ultimate Beaverville), Heywood (light industrial and residential suburbs), North Oak (sister city to Night City, and the home of the NorCal Military Base) and Westbrook (Land of the Rich and Powerful). All these suburbs were within twenty minutes (by maglev) of Central Night City. ▶ The Pacifica Playground ◀ Home of Playland by the Sea, Pacifica was an upper- class residential area nestled between the cliffs of the Pacific Ocean and Rancho Coronado. Protected by a Militech security contract, Pacifica was a fairly safe place before the War. The newly renovated Playland by the Sea was a big hit among the amusement park crowd coming down from San Francisco and brought a fair amount of tourist traffic up from the south as well. On the cliffs at Pacifica lay the expensive condos of the Coastview development, offering a view of both the open sea, and for some a view of the bright lights of Playland by the Sea below. Pacifica was the place to kick back and relax after a hard day of battles and beatdowns in the City. ▶ The North Oak Military Suburb ◀ The home of the NorCal Military Base, North Oak's towering structures and ship superstructures were a regular sight seen across the Bay from the East Marina. In the 2020s, with the Free State Wars a relatively recent memory, North Oak was a military town and most of its shops catered to servicepeople or their families, and the majority of its population was in some way or another associated with the military industrial complex. The enormous NorCal Military Base was established as part of the deal which allowed Northern California to maintain its titular independence from the Union as a Free State. The State government didn't mind, as the Base was a deterrent keeping the roadgang scum from coming north and raiding for water. Living on North Oak's wide, oak-shaded streets could be quite agreeable. The homes were pleasant, pastel-colored bungalows with identical numbered curbs. Schools were excellent and the Base Hospital, Theater, Officers, and Enlisted Clubs and the Base Exchange shopping mall provided almost anything you might have wanted. If you liked being in or around uniforms, this was the place for you.NIGHT CITY CIRCA 2020 290 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY ▶ The Rancho Coronado Beaverville ◀ The Ultimate Beaverville, with all that the name implies. South of Night City on Highway 126, Rancho Coronado extended for miles, consisting almost entirely of tract housing interspersed with small, trendy mini malls. Mostly vast featureless subdivisions, Rancho Coronado was packed full of Arasaka, Petrochem, Biotechnica, WNS, and EBM employees, all neatly slotted into rows of identical, small three-bedroom homes that reached towards the horizon. Rancho Coronado was the kind of place that made most Edgerunners break out into a cold sweat just thinking about it. ▶ The Heywood Industrial Zone ◀ A light industrial area that straddled the east of Del Coronado bay between Rancho Coronado and North Oak, Heywood had a lot of everything, some housing, a little retail shopping, a few bars and the well-known Apple Valley Corporate subdivision, a primarily Biotechnica dominated Beaverville in South Heywood. But most of Heywood's rolling hills were dotted with large, sprawling factories, industrial com- plexes, including an Arasaka Arms factory, several Biotechnica research stations, two EBM storage and research stations, and many other facilities. These bland, mass-designed industrial parks dotted the hills of Heywood, some underground, some above, some small, some sprawling over acres. At some point, there were so many of them that even the Heywood City Council didn't know all of their names or what they did. ▶ South Night City ◀ This area was chiefly a heavily industrialized port city with a battered old oil refinery terminal, a container shipping port, the Night City Municipal Sewage Treatment Plant, and miles and miles of cheap, shabby housing constructed at the turn of the century by Mob- controlled contractors. South Night City was known in the 2020s as an especially dangerous place. If you weren't waylaid and dragged into a dark alley by one of the many gangs that roamed the South Night City sprawl, it was just as likely you would be shot by some trigger-happy local mistaking you for a member of one of the aforementioned gangs. It was always a BY MAKSYM HARAHULIN 291 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY good idea to travel here during the day. At night, the fireworks started, and usually the ambulances didn't make it into the area ‘till the next morning. The largest employer in South Night City was the San Morro Bay Cargo & Container Port. The main loading and unloading terminal for container ships entering the central California area. From here, fruit, vegetables, processed foods, and manufactured goods flowed out of both Nor and SoCal in a steady stream, while imported goods flowed back in. ▶ Westbrook ◀ Westbrook was always a fortress, built on a naturally occurring set of hills overlooking Night City from across the Bay and North Oak below. It was just a very genteel and well-manicured fortress. Many of the Corporate rich had expensive homes there, and their expensive security made sure that nothing disturbed them. An Arasaka services contract made sure of it. All Westbrook residences also boasted specially coded, skin-implanted identity chips with at least three check- points on the road into the hills and several surface-to- air missile sites to make sure all air vehicles also had the proper IFF codes. Almost all the Execs working for the largest corpo- rations in Night City lived in Westbrook, including VPs and Execs from Arasaka, EBM, and Petrochem, as well as many prominent Night City personalities. Admission to Westbrook was only limited in one way: the ability to afford it. In general, Westbrook was also well-known as a very safe place for Corporations to place their high extraction-risk employees. There was only one extraction attempt in the history of Westbrook, and that left three AV-4s destroyed and 24 Militech soldiers dead; it was the first—and last—attempted extraction at Westbrook through the entire 2010s. Of course, at the time, some people in the know opined that this incident was what had started the long-run- ning rivalry between the Night City branches of Arasaka and Militech. the bADlAnDs Beyond the Night City hub and surrounding suburbs, there was a wide-open space of endless dry California scrub, punctuated by the occasional abandoned town or dry lake bed. Known as the Badlands, this was an area that few Night City inhab- itants willingly ventured out into, save for the hardy Nomads who crossed the Badlands in their huge and well-protected caravans. Oh yeah. And the gogangers. Did we forget to mention the gogangers? N ight City, Happy at Last? All in all, by 2020, Night City had evolved into a busy, successful, and dangerous urban zone. The government managed to keep the lid on, and when they failed the Corps could be depended on to re-screw the lid down with their own brand of violent and implacable savagery. Deals got made, money changed hands, some people got killed, but other people managed to avoid getting killed in turn. Night City wasn't the utopian city of Richard Night's futurist dreams, but in the main, Night City in 2020 worked. Then came the 4th Corporate War. niGht City AnD the 4th (2022) The full story of Night City in the 4th Corporate War has, by now, been the subject of many dozens of books, movies, and even a few braindances (recorded from captured fighters under extreme duress). What's more important is Night City's unique position in the chaotic, unstable world of the early 2020s. Because of its Free State status, Night City was home to units on both sides of the 4th Corporate War. The War was not kind to Night City. There was constant street-to-street, building-to-building fighting throughout the City, especially around the Corporate Zone where both factions maintained substantial office complexes. Even before the nuclear event that wiped out the center area, people were abandoning the city in droves, doing whatever they could do to avoid getting sniped by drones, crushed by tanks, or just gunned down by Corporate kill squads. A big chunk of the City was wrecked, and people were climbing all over themselves to get to safer spots like Heywood and Pacifica. Then both sides went over the line and some bright boy dropped a bomb. 292 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY the bomb (2023) In retrospect, it was just Night City's bad luck that it was a Free City in an area not controlled by a larger power like a nation. Neither of the Corporate combat- ants was stupid enough to drop a nuke in the middle of some place where the remnant U.S. or the still power- ful EuroTheatre cared about. In fact, probably the only thing that kept then-President Kress from wiping out every Arasaka stronghold on earth was the fact that Night City wasn't technically part of the U.S. So, they dropped a bomb. The power of the bomb detonated in the Arasaka Towers was about a tiny fraction of the Hiroshima bomb; basically a tactical nuke a bit larger than a \"suitcase bomb;\" it was designed to utterly demolish Arasaka's Reliquary Database Project and make it unusable to a rival Megacorp. Similar to a 1950s Davy Crockett backpack nuke, with an overall yield of .1 kiloton, the Nuke was prematurely detonated at floor 120 (366m/yds.), in Kei Arasaka's apartment bunker where the Soulkiller lab was located. The blast instantly obliterated the Arasaka Towers, splitting them in half and causing them to collapse outward. The entire central city became rubble in seconds with almost everyone in the immediate area dying instantly. And, as much of Night City was built on fill, because the elevation (5m/yds.) was originally so low, the Arasaka nuke caused a minor earthquake that liquefied parts of the fill and flooded the inner city. T HE Time of the Red The explosion was technically an air blast, as the detonation went off at roughly 366m/yds. (Little Boy, in comparison, had a detonation height of about 579m/yds.). While this lessened overall long-term radioactivity, most of what remained penetrated only the huge skyscraper towers surrounding the blast (they were later scraped off and buried as fill in the Bay). The high blast area and the tons of raw concrete and steel instantly converted into particulate debris cov- ering the entire NorCal region and far out to sea for many months, as well as igniting a fierce firestorm that covered thousands of acres beyond the City. This combined dust cloud spiraled up into the sky and turned it red with particulate matter for almost two years. Even several years after the blast, suspended particles caused the skies at dawn and dusk to glow a lurid red, inspiring people who lived through that era to call it the Time of the Red. suRvivAl moDe after the bomb (2023-2025) Night City was barely habitable within 24 hours of the detonation. Many people were unaffected by the initial fallout as they were mostly cybered up or had radioactivity filters installed in their bodies already. However, the firestorm destroyed a large part of Night City's housing, forcing people to move over to either the suburbs on the other side of the bay, or to areas further out. Worse, Night City was largely built on layers of fill: sand and earth which, triggered by the explosion of the Bomb, liquefacted and turned to jello. The shaking soil broke gas mains, water pipes, and electrical grids. Streets became twisted chunks of asphalt strewn with wrecked ground cars, while fallen AVs littered the sides of broken skyscrapers. Night City was in ruins—although still not as bad as other cities like Rio and Hong Kong. Most of the areas around Night Cit y had been abandoned during the Collapse. But now, people started moving East as soon as they could. Neighborhoods found a new unity and purpose, even if it was grudgingly and with little trust. They weren't looking for rebuilding yet. They were looking for food. the olD mAn sAys thAt iF the the olD mAn sAys thAt iF the nukenuke hAD been DetonAteD hAD been DetonAteD wheRe they PlAnneD, the heAvily wheRe they PlAnneD, the heAvily shielDeD ComPlex woulD hAve shielDeD ComPlex woulD hAve absorbedabsorbed the mAin blAst the mAin blAst AnD sAveD the Rest oF the AnD sAveD the Rest oF the City. i Don't know iF he wAs City. i Don't know iF he wAs RiGht, but i Aim to RiGht, but i Aim to findfind out. out. — Trace Santiago— Trace Santiago Trace is talking about his father, \"Nomad\" Santiago, ex-partner to Rogue and leader of the Aldecaldo Nomad nation. 293 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY In a wasteland of ruins, gangs, renegade Corporate fighters, and radioactive wreckage, Night City was in survival mode. And survival is what the inhabitants of Night City do best. the ReCoveRy after the bomb (2030-2040) President Kress blamed the Night City attack on Arasaka, although she was soon able to determine that the actual weapon used had been supplied by a Militech strike team. The Big Lie was that Arasaka blew up the Corporate Center in an area denial attack to stop Militech from seizing the Arasaka's Night City office. In point of fact, Arasaka did actually have a much larger thermonuclear device buried in the foundations of the Towers for just that reason, but the explosion of the Militech pocket nuke rendered this plan inoperable. No one knows where the Arasaka Bomb actually wound up after the Fall of the Towers, and since only a few of the upper echelon of the zai- batsu (such as Kei and his father Saburo) even knew about this fallback, the knowledge of the Arasaka weapon has since passed into the realm of rumor. the ReAlm oF ConsPiRACy & RumoR Very few people knew anything about the Militech- backed strike team or its composition. Rumor has it that Morgan Blackhand, operating as a hidden gov- ernment asset, passed the information about the failed raid on to President Elizabeth Kress independently; this is still only in the realm of rumor, as no one has seen Morgan Blackhand alive or dead since the Fall of the Towers. In any case, Kress used this (and the reactivation of General Lundee's commission) to gain leverage over Militech, bringing it to heel and nationalizing its assets as part of a resurgent U.S. government. Bringing the full force of her military and propaganda resources to bear, Kress painted a lurid picture of Arasaka as an evil foreign Megacorp run by a madman who wantonly destroyed an American city in the pursuit of personal power. Arasaka's char- ters to operate in the United States were immediately revoked, its members and board declared terrorists, and their assets either seized or driven offshore. Yet, for all this political theater, Kress showed little or no interest in helping Night City recover. Much as several previous Presidents during the Collapse had done, she wrote the city off as unrecoverable and offered sanctuary in a new United States to the surviving refugees. There were two reasons for this: First, with the resources of the United States already stretched to the breaking point, there were exceed- ingly few options left for Kress. Second, the flinty and farsighted American President saw this as the perfect way to bring the wayward \"Free State of NorCal\" (and its lucrative technology base) back into the gov- ernment's control. But stubborn to the end, Night City fought back. niGht City RebuilDinG after the bomb (2040-2045) While its impact on the United States outside of the Boston Washington (BosWash) Corridor was negligi- ble, roughly 2 million people in the greater Night City region were homeless from direct effects of the Bomb, NIGHT CITY CIRCA 2020 There are dozens, if not hundreds, of conspiracy theories surrounding the Night City holocaust. Feel free to make a few up for your game. 294 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY as well as from flooding by the liquefaction of the City's foundations (which were built on fill and sand). Survivors fled into overcrowded tent cities in the surrounding suburbs of North Oak, Westbrook, Pacifica, Heywood, and South Night City. But it was soon obvious that something needed to be done fast. The remnants of the Night City government turned to outside resources, calling in old markers and favors from a wide variety of Edgerunner allies. Recovery was led by the Nomads of the Aldecaldo Clan and their allies in the StormTech Corporation. With a lot of experience in city rebuilding since the Chicago rebuild, StormTech and the Aldecaldos were uniquely equipped to build extensive temporary housing from shipping containers and later formocrete modules brought in by rail and sea. But first, the ground needed to be cleared to put up even these rudimentary structures. Most of central Corp Zone had been destroyed. The wreckage was far too vast to move out of the area, so the survivors used bulldozers and jury-rigged main battle tanks (abandoned by both sides) to shove the debris into the Bay. Most of Night City's inner neighborhoods had already been razed to the ground in the ceaseless battles preceding the Fall of the Towers. Now, the wreckage became the fill that new mega-buildings and old cityscapes used to rise again and challenge the smog-filled skies. And the building keeps going on, despite gogangs, plagues, riots, and all those other inconveniences that are just part of the Time of the Red. This ongoing rebuilding period has also cemented Night City's relationship to the outer world. Abandoned by President Kress and her \"New\" United States, Night City has no intention of ever yoking itself to that tottering governmental shibboleth again. Kress's successors are going to be in for a really long and ugly war if they want to take this particular Free Zone back into the fold; frack, they might even ask Arasaka for help if it comes to that. As for the European Theater, the Euros can go their own way just as long as they don't mess with Night City's particular path. Like a cyberfighter who's been hit, knocked down, and rises again with a scream of heavy metal rage, Night City has dreams. Dreams of becoming the biggest, baddest, most important city on the planet one day soon. And it's a big dreamer.BY MAKSYM HARAHULIN Among the structures lost by the end of the War was the New Harbor Mallplex, a shopping mall/ arcology. 295 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY N ight City in the time of the Red bACk beFoRe he RetuRneD to the hiGh RoAD, my bACk beFoRe he RetuRneD to the hiGh RoAD, my daddad useD to useD to hAnG out in niGht City A lot. he sAiD thAt FoR All the GRunGy hAnG out in niGht City A lot. he sAiD thAt FoR All the GRunGy DAnGeRousness oF the PlACe (AnD tRust me, i've Got no illusions DAnGeRousness oF the PlACe (AnD tRust me, i've Got no illusions thAt my DAD wAsn't in the miDDle oF the thAt my DAD wAsn't in the miDDle oF the mostmost GRunGy, GRunGy, mostmost DAnGeRous PARts) theRe wAs A GlitteRinG, GoRGeous CenteR thAt DAnGeRous PARts) theRe wAs A GlitteRinG, GoRGeous CenteR thAt wAs the FliP siDe oF the euRobuCk Coin. bACk then, iF you hAD the wAs the FliP siDe oF the euRobuCk Coin. bACk then, iF you hAD the money AnD the ConneCtions, niGht City CoulD be the money AnD the ConneCtions, niGht City CoulD be the bestbest PlACe PlACe on eARth—FilleD with the beAutiFul, CybeReD-uP, AnD PoweRFul. on eARth—FilleD with the beAutiFul, CybeReD-uP, AnD PoweRFul. oF CouRse, iF you weRe (like he wAs in those DAys) A younG hiReD oF CouRse, iF you weRe (like he wAs in those DAys) A younG hiReD Gun lookinG FoR A Job, it CoulD bounCe FRom suPeR sliCk AnD Gun lookinG FoR A Job, it CoulD bounCe FRom suPeR sliCk AnD GlAm All the wAy to miseRAble AnD homiCiDAl GlAm All the wAy to miseRAble AnD homiCiDAl justjust like thAt. like thAt. toDAy, Just like in my olD mAn's DAy, whAt liFe in niGht City's like toDAy, Just like in my olD mAn's DAy, whAt liFe in niGht City's like DePenDs on DePenDs on wherewhere you ARe. neiGhboRhooDs AnD Zones vARy wilDly, you ARe. neiGhboRhooDs AnD Zones vARy wilDly, DePenDinG on whAt FACtion/GAnG/CoRPoRAtion DePenDinG on whAt FACtion/GAnG/CoRPoRAtion ControlsControls the loCAl the loCAl tuRF, AnD even then, ConDitions CAn ChAnGe on the FliP oF A euRo. but tuRF, AnD even then, ConDitions CAn ChAnGe on the FliP oF A euRo. but oveRAll, seven Zones now PRetty muCh oveRAll, seven Zones now PRetty muCh definedefine the niGht City ReGion the niGht City ReGion —Trace Santiago—Trace Santiago Night City is a city in the process of rebuilding even now. The old Neighborhood Zones of the 2020 period have been rearranged, renamed, or even scraped off into the Bay if they're still too radioactive. Instead of neighbor- hoods, locals now refer to these new areas based on the type of environment they're dominated by: Hot Zone, Rebuilding Urban Center, Executive Zone, Overpacked Suburbs, Reclaimed Perimeter, and The Open Road. Zone Type Description Hot Zone The area most affected by the Night City Nuke, this is blasted terrain full of wrecked, twisted skyscrapers, burned-out vehicles, and entombed bodies of the unlucky. Rebuilding Urban Center These are parts of the city that escaped the worst of both the War and the bomb. In the Rebuilding Center, cranes and construction gear are everywhere, building new Corporate towers and crowded urban megabuildings. Executive Zone This is a special area of the City that has been cordoned off and gated for the use of High-Level Corporate executives and their families only. Combat Zone The most dangerous and lawless part of the city which grew out of the original Combat Zone in the wake of the 4th Corporate War. The only justice here comes from the barrel of a gun. Overpacked Suburbs Now filled with sprawling tent cities and unregulated refugee camps crammed with the displaced of the War, this is a place on the edge of disaster, where once safe and secure \"Beavervilles\" stood. Reclaimed Perimeter This is the area just outside the City's sprawl. On the edge of lawlessness, save for the areas controlled by the Nomad Families. The Open Road This is the open highway, populated only by people in transit or roving boostergangs on spiky ground cars and motorcycles. 296 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY In addition to this urban re-designation, each new area has now been given a Threat Rating by the City Council: a designation of just how dangerous the area is and what kind of threats might be encountered there. You can find more about these Threat Ratings below. thReAt RAtinGs In Night City, Threat Rating are used to profile armed opponents and levels of overall danger that may be encountered within major areas of the City. Here's a brief rundown on each:NIGHT CITY CIRCA 2045 297 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY Threat Rating Description Executive This is a secure gated neighborhood which is only accessible to the ultra-rich and powerful, who live there, playing golf and tennis under the protection of armed security. This is connected to the Rebuilding Urban Center via maglev so you can go to work. Corporate These are parts of the city patrolled by Corporate security which are safe from the carnage of the Combat Zone. However, they have their own kind of danger. Danger with a much higher budget. Moderate These are the parts of the city that exude out of Corporate Zones, where the people who can't afford to live there do so here in relative safety... that is compared to the carnage of the Combat Zones. Unfortunately, what happens in the Combat Zones doesn't always stay there, and sometimes it leaks into the Moderate Zone. Combat These are the worst places in the city, where people die, and nobody cleans it up afterwards. Outskirts This is the area just outside the City's sprawl.. The only laws here are the ones you make for yourself. Likely, you'll only run into road gangers and Nomads if you're out here. Note that while the majority of a region might fit into a specific Threat Rating that doesn't mean a region may not have other Threat Ratings in and around the main classification. An area undergoing reconstruction or gentrification may have several Threat Ratings, or even be transitioning from one Rating type to another. Remember that treasure map idea we mentioned back on page 288? ▶ The Hot Zone ◀ Threat Rating: Combat This is the area that used to be the central city Corporate Zone. While much of this area has been bulldozed into the Bay as fill, the remainder is still a haunted landscape of wrecked, twisted skyscrapers, burned-out vehicles, and entombed bodies of the unlucky. Although the radiation has subsided, it's still present, and most people have abandoned the area to the worst of the gangs. If you go here, you probably are either a ganger, suicidal, or driven there to find something that's hidden in the endless wreckage. Old Neighborhood Zones included in the Hot Zone Wasteland are: The Old Bank Block: Housing all of the old banks of Night City, the Bank Block is mostly rubble but it was never cleared out officially. The Old City Center: Only radioactive ruins remain of the once-bustling City Center. The Old Corporate Center: Once the heart of the Corporations of Night City, the Corporate Center is a ruin of its former glory. The Old Medical Center: Largely irradiated, the Old Medical Center houses many hospitals buried under rubble. ▶ The Rebuilding Urban Center ◀ Threat Rating: Corporate/Moderate Not all of Night City was obliterated in the holocaust. Already heavily built up with skyscrapers and densely packed urban construction, a considerable amount of the urban center has survived. But the detonation and subsequent destruction has damaged the seawalls and breakwaters that kept the Bay and the outer Pacific Ocean from overwhelming the fill the majority of the Central City stood on. Periodic flooding is a regular occurrence, and power and water are chancy at best. The NCART subway still runs, when it isn't flooded by the tide; the City planners are working to raise the majority of the track into a new monorail configuration, but that will take time and money the City scarcely has. 298 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY In the Rebuilding Center, cranes and construction gear (like the ubiquitous Zhirafa mechanoids) are everywhere. The looming skeletons of new corporate towers rise from the ruins of the Old City, patrolled by vigilant private armies and mechanical sentry drones. The work never stops, and the Center is always alight with the slam of heavy machines and brilliant with construction arc lights. Chief among these new con- structions are the rising mega-buildings of the Watson Urban Reconstruction Zone; all-in-one mini-arcologies designed to house the millions of people who were forced to leave their homes when the Nuke went off. Neighborhood Zones included in the Rebuilding Urban Center are: The Glen: A burgeoning new district which contains most of the important governmental buildings of Night City. Little Europe: A divided district composed of tightly knit neighborhoods made up of old brick buildings and tall sky scrapers alike. NorCal Military Base: A heavily fortified mili- tary base north of Night City, staffed primarily by Militech soldiers. Mostly shut off from the rest of the City. Pacifica Playground: A largely Corporate- sponsored district built around the Playland by the Sea amusement park, which is in the midst of massive development. Upper Marina: A bustling urban district with a mix of old industrial zones and gentrified \"International\" style neighborhoods built around a well-maintained marina. University District: A slim district on the edge of the Combat Zones which houses the city's only still functioning university. Watson Development: A developing district where megabuildings and arcologies are being built to house the thousands of homeless from the War. Much of Night City's Asian population has moved to the Watson neighborhood colloquially known as Kabuki. ▶ The Executive Zone ◀ Threat Rating: Executive. This area is a special gated and heavily defended community reserved for High Ranking Corporate Execs and their families. As well as luxury homes, this area has its own shopping and recreational facilities, including golf courses, private spas, and clubs. The Executive Zone: A new Zone with only one district for the safety and pleasure of the Corporate elite, carved out of the open hills surrounding the City. ▶ The Combat Zones ◀ Threat Rating: Combat Gangs are the absolute rulers of the Combat Zones. Moving between the slums, tenements, and ruins of abandoned city blocks, the gangs and their allies divide up turf, control the limited resources, and kill anyone or anything that gets in the way. There's no reconstruction going on in the Combat Zones, although sometimes Corporate or City Lawmen drop down on the area like a ton of ferrobrix and start killing the gangers wholesale, a process the City likens to trimming back kudzu.BY NEIL BRANQUINHO For a listing of locations in Night City during the Time of the Red, skip ahead to page 310. 299 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY Neighborhood Zones included in the Combat Zones are: Old Japantown: A once, popular Japanese cultural center that fell into chaos and disrepair during the 4th Corporate War. Much of the population has moved to Watson and the area is now mostly empty save for the gangs. Little China: A sprawling, dangerous Chinatown with many small communities fighting to stay alive and fend off the gangs of the Combat Zones. Old Combat Zone: A district of the City long ago abandoned to the gangs and psychos, the Old Combat Zone is the seed that the rest of the Combat Zones grew from. South Night City: An industrial sprawl, filled with trigger-happy gangs and abandoned warehouses repurposed into hide-outs and headquarters. ▶ The Overpacked Suburbs ◀ Threat Rating: Moderate/Combat In the aftermath of the War, most of central Night City was uninhabitable, not because of residual radiation, but from the loss of power, sewer, and water services. The suburbs became host to a huge number of tent cities and unregulated refugee camps smack in the middle of what had previously been safe suburban corporate \"Beavervilles.\" While huge mega-buildings are under construction to house the refugees, this region is crowded, crime-ridden, and on the edge of disaster all the time. Neighborhood Zones included in the Overpacked Suburbs are: Heywood: A truly overpacked sector of the City, housing a large percentage of the City's population and already starting to divide based on wealth and power—The rich in the north, the poor in the south (who call the area Santo Domingo instead). Heywood Industrial Zone: The largest industrial zone in the City, overflowing with warehouses, construction equipment, factories, and even some derelict cargo ships. New Westbrook: An urban sprawl built in the remains of the original Executive Zone, still gleaming with glitz and glam, but now packed with homeless citizens who either fled other areas of Night City because of the War or who were pushed out more recently by the ongoing gentrification of the Rebuilding Urban Center. Rancho Coronado: A vast stretch of old Beaverville style housing, taken over by tent cities and industrial zones that have grown out of the corpses of previ- ous mini-malls. ▶ The Reclaimed Perimeter ◀ Threat Rating: Outskirts While Night City was the regional hub, it was sur- rounded by a constellation of smaller towns and suburbs. Most of these were abandoned during the 2000-2020 period, as they were too far out to protect from the roving gogangs that plagued the area. Now, supported by Nomad Families and private security, the Reclaimers are attempting to make new homes for the dispossessed of the City in many of these abandoned places. Neighboring C ities included in the Reclaimed Perimeter are: Atascadero, Avila Beach, Cambria, Los Osos, Paso Robles, Pismo Beach, San Luis Obispo, and San Simeon ▶ The Open Road ◀ Threat Rating: Outskirts In the 2020s, the Open Road was home to roving gogangers and well-defended Nomad caravans. But as the Nomad Families take greater control of the world's commerce and shipping, they're using surplus military hardware to drive out the gogangs and make the roads safe for travel. The roads are still open, wide, and dusty, with dead and burned-out vehicles littering some areas, but more and more the Open Road is looking a bit more like Route 66 than Mad Max. Old Highways included in the Open Road Zones are: California State Route 41, California State Route 46, California State Route 58, California State Route 99, California State 828, Interstate Highway 5, and Interstate Highway 101 300 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY ChAnGe is CominG In the Time of the Red, Night City is a city in the midst of massive change. Areas are constantly being rebuilt. The first temporary housing is rapidly being replaced by a new generation of gigantic mega-buildings. Modeled after the old New Harbor Mall Arcology (which was destroyed by shellfire in 2022), these towering structures encompass living spaces, enter- tainment, food courts, and shopping malls all in their centralized hubs. As time goes on, these will probably evolve to be the main habitable space in the Night City. the new un-noRmAl Services are spotty, the law is chancy, and you can't run the NET to the edge of space anymore, much less grab an Orbital Air luxury flight up to the Crystal Palace. But in general, things still work in Night City. You may not be able to get the latest digital Agent or the best weapons on the market (there's still a major problem with supply chains that were disrupted by the War), but thanks to the explosion of rooftop and green-wall gardens, bandit solar collectors, and refabbed hardware from your friendly neighborhood Tech, you're actually eating better (when you eat), have access to more reliable power and gear, and can even count on the local Fixer setting you up with new drugs and new cyberware right off the (illicit) Streets. It's not the Golden Age of the 2020s, choomba. But The Street still works. T he Particulars PolitiCAl PolitiCAl powerpower GRows out GRows out oF the bARRel oF A oF the bARRel oF A gungun.. —Mao Tse-Tung—Mao Tse-Tung PolitiCAl PoweRs Politically, the current Night City is more or less run (and we use the term loosely indeed) by a junta of old city government, Edgerunner and Nomad factions, and the few Corporations whose assets have survived the War. This City Council is dominated by the most aggressive or charismatic members of these disparate factions, including: • The Nomad Families • The Edgerunners, including Netrunners, Solos, Rockerboys, and other \"cyberpunk\" types • The old City government • The Corporate interests of Biotechnica, Continental Brands, Danger Girl, Militech, Network 54, Petrochem, Rocklin Augmentics, SovOil, Trauma Team, Ziggurat, Zhirafa and (recently and covertly) Arasaka. Since Night City is far too chaotic post-War to have a centralized City government, the Night City Council is made up of City Managers from the different dis- tricts and neighborhoods of the City. Even the Combat Zones have City Managers, though they have effec- tively no control over the gangs of the Zones. A City Manager chosen by their fractious group is nominally in charge of each area of the City —as opposed to a mayor, which is a purely ceremonial title that still remains in some areas like San Francisco. The Council and City Managers are theoretically in charge of: • The local sections of the Data Pool. • Zoning designations for Corporations and neighborhoods. • Road and infrastructure taxes (collected from Corps, factions, and neighborhoods). • Freelance PI and Police licensing. • City contracts for construction and justice services. There is no mayor or central leadership, and fights between factions are frequent and often settled on The Street with weapons over negotiation. No one faction holds the upper hand, but between shifting alliances and agendas, somehow things generally get done without descending into open warfare on The Streets. Although badly underfunded and strapped for supplies, Night City has its own Police, Fire, and Emergency Service Departments. Maintained by a levy on the local Corps and neighborhoods, these small units are heavily armed and operate Citywide. For more information on the Corps with influence in the Time of the Red see page 267. There's a list of powerful people in Night City starting on page 304. 301 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY PubliC seRviCes ▶ Hospitals ◀ The two public hospitals established in the 2020 years (City Medical Center and Crisis Medical Center) are still in existence in the Central Night City area, but they suffer from lower-level flooding and regular disruption of services such as water, power, and communications. The hospitals are, however, the last stand for major surgery and the ability to handle the periodic plague outbreaks that were common in the period right after the Fall. There are now a number of constantly shifting clinics which have become the Time of the Red's main source of medical care; outgrowths of the often-covert ripperdocs of the 2020s, they're where most people go to get medicine, emergency care, and moderate level cyberware installations. The City also maintains a large cryobody bank, a holdover from the days immediately following the Fall when corpses were choking the streets; these cavernous, refrigerated chambers are packed with racked cold slabs filled with bodies. ▶ Information ◀ Data Terms, established in the 2010s, are still located on the corners of many (30%) City Streets, and can be used to access information, computer services, fax-mail, and NET input. It's a testament to how inde- structibly they were constructed that they still operate even under the most rudimentary conditions. However, enterprising Netrunners, Techs, and Fixers have taken to rewiring some terms to require a pass card or other payment system in order to access their chosen ‘Terms. Most Data Terms are also patched into the local Data Pool system, allowing them to be used to phone booths, message services, news readers, and Pop Media access points. ▶ The NET ◀ Overall, the War has totally wiped out most NET traffic outside the City; what has survived the destruction of NET nodes and wiring infrastructure was severely compromised by a deadly cyber virus that ravaged the Ihara-Grubb protocol systems at the War's end. This \"DataKrash,\" rumored to be the creation of deranged master Netrunner Rache Bartmoss shortly before his death in 2021, has made running the greater NET an almost suicidal proposition; the remnants of Netwatch (the global police of the NET), have pretty much banned Netrunners from large sections of the Architecture to keep the Krash from spreading. This is implemented by literally destroying key NET nodes in the system and taking still others offline. What NET traffic still exists in the Time of the Red is limited to heavily secured VPN or \"airgapped\" systems limited to on-site traffic within a single build- ing or campus. ▶ The Data Pool ◀ The Data Pool is a Citywide information network built on the backbone of the earlier Data Term systems of the pre-Red era. Information servers and exchange systems designed for open use within the limits of a city, Data Pools produce free, open content created through the collaborative efforts of a community of users. In design, they're similar to the hyper-stack \"page\" system attempted and then abandoned for the NET in the early '90s. lAw AnD oRDeR Between the War and the Fall of the Towers, law enforcement in Night City literally fell apart. Gradually, random Solos and Law Enforcement Officers began to reassert control over the roving gangs and looters on a neighborhood-by-neigh- borhood basis. The more money the locals had to throw at the problem, the better these ad hoc police units were, with Corporate \"rent-a-cops\" getting the best vehi- cles and hardware overall. With their limited assets, Lawman bribery is common and corruption the standard. The only real survivors of the old Night City PD are the members of the C-SWAT aka MAX-TAC aka \" The Cyberpsycho\" Squad. Incorruptible to the last and still led by their commander, Max Hammerman, this lone bastion of the NCPD maintains an iron-fisted control over any and all suspected cyberpsychotic elements in the City. Data Terms also make great cover in case you were wondering. They count as Thick Concrete (25 HP). 302 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY ▶ I Don't Need No Stinking Badges ◀ While Night City (and most Reclaimed City Zones) maintain their own Citywide police forces, other areas just hire a Security force to protect key city buildings like the local Records Hall and Council Offices. For these guys (and others) law enforce- ment services are instead licensed to a variety of professional, Neocorporate, private police, and local forces deputized to patrol/control a specific area by the owners of that area. These include: ▶ MAX-TAC ◀ Once a part of the Night City Police Department, MAX-TAC is now a fully independent organization in its own right. It contracts with neighborhoods, governments, and even private citizens to take care of the most egregious assaults on the public: hostage situations, cyberpsychos, military class weapons, terrorists, etc. MAX-TAC is run by the incorruptible Commander Max Hammerman, late of the original Night City Police Forces. Hammerman is a man on a mission: to maintain law and order and protect the innocent. MAX-TAC has an impartial code that it follows to the letter—it ends fights, no matter who starts them. If you're a security service guy fighting a bunch of boosters, you'd better put your weapons down when MAX-TAC shows up or they'll open fire on you too. MAX-TAC doesn't hold prisoners; arrestees are remanded to the local Hall of Justice/ Security Facility. ▶ Security Services ◀ These are represented by the thousands of uniformed \"rent-a-cops\" hired to patrol urban areas, office blocs, and upscale living areas. The largest of these is Lazarus Security, the heir to the 2020s' ubiquitous Arasaka and Militech. These Security Services have arrest authority, but maintain no jails; prisoners are remanded to whatever local Justice/Security Facility is in the area. ▶ Corporate Security ◀ Similar to Security Services, these are forces directly related to a Corporation. They often do not have arrest authority or the right to maintain jails, but rumors abound of covert prisons beneath Corporate HQs.BY EDDIE MENDOZA 303 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY ▶ Personal Bodyguards ◀ These are personal security forces that have been licensed and bonded by the local City government, much like getting a Private Investigator's license in the old days. Personal bodyguards are licensed to use maximum force only in the event their clients are in immediate physical danger. Without arrest authority they must call local Private Police Forces or Security Forces to take prisoners. ▶ Freelance Police ◀ A variation of personal bodyguards, these are Solos hired to provide security and protection for a neigh- borhood. Protectors \"patrol the beat\" of their area, dealing with threats as they turn up. Freelance Police have arrest authority, as granted by the neighborhood they work for. They sometimes have holding cells, but more often as not remand prisoners to the local Hall of Justice/Security Facility. ▶ Transport: NCTC ◀ The Night City Transit Corporation (NCTC) provides bus services on most major city thoroughfares. NCART (Night City Area Rapid Transit), a public corporation with some private (read: Corporate) funding, has mostly been submerged under several hundred feet of salt water with the collapse of the Night City water table, but there are plans to rebuild the flooded sections above ground and extend the new monorail to cover the growing suburban areas of: North Oak, New Westbrook, Pacifica, Heywood, and Watson. ▶ Transport: Night City Metro ◀ The local airport, handling both domestic and interna- tional flights. If there were any. Once again, the chaos of the War disrupted most regular transit—private jets and aerodynes exist only for the wealthy. As part of the reclamation of the City, plans are underway to establish an orbital spaceplane/delta massdriver launch site on Morro Rock (A volcanic batholith, it is the most geologically stable area in the entire region). ▶ Transport: Freeways ◀ Night City is on State Highway 828, which runs east to connect to I-5. Ground transit to San Francisco is about 4 hours (due to road gang activity and bad roads); to LA is about 6 hours. ▶ Transport: The Nomads ◀ The most reliable transportation in or out of Night City comes via the services of the Nomad Clans. Individual Clans sponsor heavily armed convoys to cities along the Coast, the West, and even to the edges of the New United States. These convoys, often made up of over a hundred vehicles ranging in size from giant multifamily Kombis to small armed escort cycles, are capable of fending off even the most determined road-gangs and rogue mercenary groups. Sea-based Clans have commandeered everything from abandoned luxury liners to gigantic container ships and pressed them into service; these are also a reliable way to get out of Night City via the sea lanes. ▶ Transport: By Air and Even Space ◀ Need to travel faster? Nomad Clans now control a sizable percentage of the Aerozep (modern cargo blimps) traffic around the region and overseas, usually backed up by satellite snub fighters and AVs. There are few actual commercial jets or other winged air- craft available (too expensive to operate), but if you're really in a hurry, there are an assortment of ex-ESA (European Space Agency) or Orbital Highrider pilots commanding their own suborbital scram-jets—like the legendary Han Solo, these \"Deltajocks\" go out of their way to avoid legal entanglements and will move any cargo (including you) for the right price. Of course, there's already a working high-security monorail that runs in a loop from the Executive Zone to Little Europe and the Watson Development. Money talks.BY ALEXANDER DUDAR 304 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY P eople of Night City Who to know, who to avoid, and who to get jobs from in Night City. PoweR PlAyeRs oF niGht City the moverS and ShakerS who run the city. Bes Isis (Media): Bes Isis is a well-known freelance Media who has a reputation for being slightly off-balance when it comes to scooping other Medias. More than once, she's broken a few rules to get the inside scoop on a big story, sometimes at significant personal cost. She has one chrome leg and a similar replacement for half of her chest. These were necessary after she faked injury to get a story on \"meat jumping.\" Blacklist (Tech): A onetime renegade chemical/ cyber-engineer from the Biotechnica Corporation, Blacklist makes his presence known in Night City in several ways. He is the man that boostergangs see to get \"personalized\" cybernetics, the man that Corporations see to get viruses synthesized, and the man who the police talk to when they need help in identifying and analyzing chemicals used in crimes. After a dispute with Biotechnica he made peace with Niccolo Loggagia and found new employment as a designer for Biotechnica's bio-engineered replacement fauna. David Ling Po (Exec): Born in Hong Kong, David Ling Po emigrated with his family to the United States in 2014. A graduate, (Summa Cum Laude) of Stanford University, in every respect Ling Po appears to be a model businessman and pillar of the community. But behind his mask of respectabil- ity, Ling Po is head of the Weng Fang Tong, the largest and most powerful Chinese criminal orga- nization in the western United States. The Weng Fang Tong controls all gambling, loan sharking, and prostitution in much of Night City. Almost all the boostergangs operating in Little China are on Ling Po's payroll and he uses them as enforcers for his various dealings. Operating from the top floor of his export business, he monitors the district via his numerous hirelings, each equipped with a telescopic video micro-camera replacing one eye. Their information is sent via scrambled signal to Mr. Ling Po. Dr. Edward Michaels, PhD (Exec): Dean of Night City University (because no one else wants the job). Anyone who wants anything from the University will eventually meet him. He's balding and in his late seventies, but still runs every morning to keep in shape, aided by his new Rocklin Augmentics cyber- legs. Dr. Michaels is a distinctly open and honest man, and made his reputation for excellence in the academic circles during his term on the Pacifica school board. He has made deals with various groups of Edgerunners in the interest of defending his university in the Time of the Red. Michaels also believes that everyone at NCU should be treated equally, while many of his colleagues believe that total Corporate sponsorship is the way to go. Fiona Hayes (Media): Where one finds scandal, graft, or corruption, one can also be fairly sure of finding Net 54 star, Fiona Hayes. A Night City institution, she's in the habit of turning up where she is most definitely unwanted, usually accompanied by a hand-picked, seasoned camera crew and a battery of tough questions. Her investigations have uncovered political and corporate crime, scandal, and conspiracy. Many a once-powerful person lives in jail or retired shame due to a Fiona Hayes' inves- tigation. Naturally, Fiona's journalistic exploits have made her a marked woman, and she sometimes lives like a fugitive for months at a time to avoid assassination by the targets of her investigations. She'll turn up only when her report is complete and her evidence solid, cornering her mark with a camera crew somewhere nice and public. Even if the only response is a \"no-comment\" the report she logs is usually enough to snowball matters to their inevitable conclusion. There's a rumor on the streets that she's not the first Fiona Hayes and she won't be the last. Fireman (Fixer): Fireman is the most well-known of the many local arms dealers. His main distinc- tion comes from the fact that he supplies many of the legitimate businesses with security systems in addition to the weapons their bouncers/hired In a former life, Bes Isis was a member of Samurai, the band fronted by Johnny Silverhand. Fiona Hayes isn't the only journalist around who might not be the original. A lot of Medias use the nom de plume \"Thompson\" when they want to publish a particularly dangerous story without having it traced back to them. 305 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY Solos use. Fireman was initially a cyber-soldier in the SouthAm War who used his contacts after leaving the service to supply his modest business. In addition to his arms dealing, Fireman is also involved in information dealing, something that makes him very popular with Edgerunners in the city. A regular in the Afterlife, he is well-known in the Solo community. Franklin M'bolu (Tech): As a developer of many of Orbital Air's leading technologies, M'bolu is in charge of building the company's forthcoming massdriver. Constructed within the Morro Rock, the massdriver will allow space planes to be launched into LEO. Franklin M'bolu is the hard-bargaining man originally responsible for managing OA's contracts and purchases in the U.S. He is rumored in some circles to supplement his income by dealing some of this technology and information on the black markets. Garven Haakensen (Fixer): Once the Assistant Mayor, \"Councilman\" Haakensen can always be found in his office. He has contacts with all the special interest groups, as well as the Corporations and organized crime. Or, to be more specific, they all have contacts with him. So far, he has been able to juggle all this for years without anyone being the wiser, and, given the fact that there's no longer an official Mayor of Night City, he's the closest thing the Council has to a favor-granting power broker. Hornet (Fixer): A self-made man with a score of enemies, Hornet has become a well-known and respected Fixer in the City in the last several years. Originally a small-time forger from Heywood, Hornet made his bones working with Arasaka during the tail end of the 4th Corporate War, pro- viding deadly chemical weapons, at least some of which were of his own design. Post-War, Hornet has edged his way into most markets in the City, making alliances with many of the Nomad Pack on the out- skirts and snapping up talented Techs and Medtechs to work for him. If you need cybertech, biotech, or drugs, Hornet is the man to talk to. He travels often, maintaining several offices throughout the City and is never without his bodyguard: a masked, monoka- tana-wielding Solo named Fox. Lucius Rhyne (Rockerboy): A community orga- nizer in the newly forming Watson Development, Lucius is a rare idealist working to make the world a better place. He is well-known for his inspiring speeches and calls to action. Mister Kernaghan (Fixer): Before the 4th Corporate War, Mister Kernaghan worked IT for the Night City Port Authority. When the Nuke went off and the port shut down, he grabbed as much data as he could and ran. Once he was secure and away from the radiation, Mister Kernaghan used those shipping manifests and filed route plans to build his empire. At first, he hired teams to retrieve essentials like food, water, and medicine and sell them to local gangs and Nomad Packs but as Night City began to recover, Mister Kernaghan moved up the chain to rarer, and more profitable, goods. Now a wealthy man, Mister Kernaghan and his cat, Kosmos, hold court over quarterly Midnight Markets where the elite come to buy luxury items like Aerozeps, Cryo- Max suits, and one-of-a-kind collectibles. Nostradamus (Media): Unlike the Nostradamus of the 1400s, this one specializes not in the future, but in the past and present. He is somewhat of a recluse, living in a converted warehouse that has many defenses. Inside the warehouse lies the biggest collection of real books that are left in the City. Nostradamus uses these books along with a gigantic mainframe to compile all the information that he can. To facilitate this collection, he often hires Netrunners to acquire the saleable information he's known for brokering. The Other Dr. Bob (Medtech): One of the few sur- geons in the City who didn't get his training from the military. The Other Dr. Bob does a lot of cybernetic implants for boostergangs, but he won't do facial reconstruction for posers. Years ago, this was just a limit of his skill but since losing his hands to one of the many John F. Kennedy Juniors of Night City The Other Dr. Bob has harbored a deep hatred of poser gangs. To make matter's worse, people keep mistaking him for Dr. Bob Jones, one of the Faces of Trauma Team. Phoenix Redwyne (Medtech): When Phoenix quit her job at Trauma Team, she had a plan: do some jobs, raise some money, and open a clinic of A sure-fire way to piss off Hornet is to ask him about his house. Rumor has it he had a nice place in the 'burbs once. With a white picket fence and everything! 306 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY her very own. Then the 4th Corporate War came and blew her plans all to hell. Instead of earning enough cash to open a fancy new clinic Phoenix made do with whatever she could find. She opened the first version of her clinic, 'From the Embers' in a tent on the outskirts of the city. Over the years the clinic's moved from tent to storage container to abandoned storefront to its current location: a con- verted garage. These days, Phoenix keeps the lights of her clinic on thanks to community donations and a complicated network of contacts. After over two decades of patching up the people of Night City, pretty much anyone who is anyone owes Phoenix a favor or two. Queen Morosha (Solo): A rising star in the Solo community, Queen Morosha is a mysterious figure who fought her way out of the Combat Zone to become one of the most well-known Solos in Night City in just a few years. Already, she's made a name for herself as the \"Queen of Solos\", running a small but astonishingly effective organization of freelancer killers and bodyguards. Unlike many other Solos, Queen Morosha has an extremely visible persona, taking interviews about her work, her organization, and making appearances from time to time. It's safe to say her meteoric rise and her self-proclaimed title have ruffled some feathers but as of yet no challenger has managed to take down the Queen. Rex Royale (Fixer): For those who live on the edge of the Combat Zones, safety is a primary concern. Where do the Combat Zones stop? Rex says it's where he stops it. That's why you pay him to protect you from it. It's not like the police will. Straddling the line between protection racket and public service, Rex's Community Solos keep the Fixer popular enough with his neighbors to keep them paying him. To his credit, Rex actually cares about the commu- nity, occasionally organizing pancake breakfasts and the like. He's just not a charity. Rogue (Solo): Once upon a time Rogue and her ex-partner Santiago were the best hit men and bodyguards in the business. After traumatic events of the Night City holocaust, Rogue retired and took over operation of the Afterlife. Now, she holds court with the local Solos and occasionally acts as a go between with potential contacts. William Joseph \"Billy Joe\" Brentwood (Exec): To most of the people he meets, Billy Joe Brentwood is still the congenial, backslapping, loudmouthed executive in charge of the Dallas-based Petrochem's Night City office; a spinner of good-natured fish stories and tall tales of a rowdy youth in the Texas Free State. Those a little closer know the truth. Behind the high-profile, free-spending exterior is a ruthless, ambitious Exec who cares little who he cuts down on his way to the top, as long as he doesn't besmirch his public image. Brentwood is rumored to have his fingers in many pies, including local and national politics. His lifestyle has made him no stranger to scandal—he's a favorite target of black- mailers and investigative reporters, but many of the people trying to coerce him, or expose his shadier side, have turned up face down in the harbor or disappeared completely. Dr. Wu Chii Lee (Medtech): Now ensconced in the Watson Development, the elderly Dr. Lee is a healer, priest, fortune-teller, and herbal pharmacist to the people. Lee is also well known and respected by his peers for having his finger on the pulse of Night City's Asian communities. Information flows like a stream through his hands, often directed by him to where it will do the most good. To most people, he seems to be a simple herbalist who speaks only his native Cantonese. But if faced with an interesting problem, or shown proper respect, this facade is quickly done away with, and he can be of great help. bADAsses oF niGht City A few notable people you never want to cross. Dillon Murphy (Solo): Dillon is a soft-spoken, middle-aged Solo who built a solid reputation on The Street for a cool head and a fast .44. He speaks with a thick Irish accent and bears a resemblance to a certain Rory McGuire, an I.R.A. gunner from Belfast who escaped from a maximum-security prison several decades back. Behind his back, he is known as the \"White Knight of Night City\" because of a chivalrous streak that causes him to protect women and children—sometimes without pay. Rumor has it, he married a pretty red-head 307 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY and settled down to raise a horde of children. But he can still be found on The Street from time to time, especially around Father Kevin's church. Eran Malour (Tech): A decorated veteran of the brushfire wars of South America, Eran Malour decided he had seen enough. After eight years in the Marines, Malour returned to the United States, and using his veteran's benefits started up his own business. A skilled armorer, he began building custom weapons for his friends and soon gathered a following among many Solos in Night City. In 2016, Malour convinced some of his best customers to invest in plans to expand his business. He purchased a small robotics factory that had been rendered obsolete by recent innovations in zero-gee manu- facturing. He then modified the factory with his own specifications to design, produce, and modify any firearm to the desires of the customer. He's mostly retired now, but he'll do you up a weapon if he especially likes you. One of his more notable clients has been Johnny Silverhand for whom he's built a succession of personalized handguns. Father Kevin (Solo): To no one's surprise, Father Kevin of Holy Angels Church was a Solo in his younger days and saw action in a dozen or more countries. When he grew sick of wholesale destruc- tion and human intolerance, he came to the conclu- sion that only charity and divine grace could save humanity. He and his church will provide sanctuary and mediate disputes for anyone who asks (and is willing to turn over their weapons). Father Kevin's record for peacefully settling gang or Corporation problems is exceptional even in the chaos of the Time of the Red. Fox (Solo): Fox is a tall slender woman, at least as far as one can tell from her voice. When she was younger she cultivated an intimidating presence, always wearing stylish black from head to toe, her face barely visible behind a net inset in her hood, speaking little. As Hornet's bodyguard for many years she made her bones disappointing an almost constant stream of people wanting to kill her colorful principal during his rapid climb through the power structures of Night City. At this point she is well known and respected in Night City but continues her affectations just because she's used to it. She prefers killing people in quiet but effective ways. Rumor has it that she has taken to training young Solos in her quiet but effective ways but, of course, no one knows for sure. Green Thumb (Solo): Born in Night City to a family of Nigerian immigrants, Green Thumb signed up with Militech when the War really broke out. He served ‘til the end of the conflict and returned to a partially obliterated home. With his family and many of his friends dead, his home destroyed, and his body heavily augmented with borgware, Green Thumb was left with nothing but the will to build something from the ashes. Post-War, Green Thumb is one of the many rooftop gardeners of Night City's Rebuilding Urban Center. Still heavily augmented and well trained from years of combat, he has formed a loose coalition of rooftop gardeners and farmers whom he protects from gangers and Corps like Continental Brands. Kenshiro Saeba (Lawman): A one-time Solo who served in the SouthAm War, Kenshiro works as a private investigator in Little Europe, where he picked up the nickname \"The Night Hunter.\" Years ago, when he cracked a kidnapping case involving Yasume Kanzaki and a rival Mob boss, he was temporarily forced to pull up stakes and hide out in Japantown for several years. A hella- cious hand with a gun and a good man to have backing you in a fight, Kenshiro has many con- tacts in local law enforcement but not all approve of his methods. \"The Knife\" (Solo): A Yakuza assassin now oper- ating in the Night City area. A master of disguise, no one knows what The Knife looks like, or who they might be. And when they could be anyone you meet, you'll never see them coming. It's rumored that \"The Knife\" may actually be a code name for a number of assassins. If you need to reach them— think twice—you can send the message \"Katana\" to a ZChat account known to a few select Fixers. Recluse (Netrunner): Very little is known about the hermitic Netrunner living in the heart of the Combat Zone's Old Japantown district. But everyone in the Combat Zone knows you don't go into the old Kaifū Corner shopping complex unless you're looking for trouble or you need a top-tier Netrunner. For the last several years, Recluse has lived in the abandoned Kenshiro is known for taking cases most PI firms, including Danger Girl, won't touch. 308 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY mini-mall, installing expensive, covert defenses and complex NET Architectures that most Edgerunners could only dream of acquiring. She only speaks with clients who can shell out big time cash and never meets anyone in person. Recluse prefers to meet clients in the lobby of her NET Architecture, where she appears in the form of her Icon, a tremendous brown recluse spider with an icy voice. Some say she's an ex-Netwatch agent, hiding out from her former employers; some say she's really an A.I.; and some people even say Recluse is a Net Ghost who lives in the Old NET. But there's one thing everyone in the Combat Zone knows: if you need a NET cracked, no matter how airtight, you go to Recluse. Woodchipper (Nomad): The rise of the Nomads during the Time of the Red has led to a steady increase in conflicts between Nomad Families. When they seek mediation, Woodchipper's garage on the outskirts of Night City is often their destination. From squabbles over reclaimed land to interpersonal conflicts, they throw it all to the Woodchipper. For her clients, she is equal parts extralegal judge, private investigator, and marriage counselor. In her garage, weapons are not allowed and all seeking violence are removed violently by 270 lbs. of peace-loving, subdermally armored Nomad and her internal linear frame. GAnGs oF niGht City The streets of Night City are alive and crawling with gangs. By day, The Street may still be the province of Corporate Execs and commuting Beavers. But at night, the predators slither out from under their rocks and trash heaps, and the City howls. Call them gutter-rats, night crawlers, trash, or street scum; the gangs are the ultimate rulers of the City's night. Whether it's a small pack of a dozen, or an army of two hundred, each gang in Night City is as diverse as The Street itself; guardians, chromers, dorphers, and freaks all thrown together in a lethal cocktail, mixed and sprinkled liberally with blood. Meet the gangs. Meet your worst nightmares. 6th Street: Born from the many veterans of the 4th Corporate War, the 6th Street is a vigilante gang which protects various neighborhoods around Night City. Members of the 6th Street are generally well-armed and heavily cybered-up with armament from their days in the field. Recently, they have been forced to move into extortion and smuggling in efforts to pay their bills. While they operate all throughout the city, the 6th Street all are welcome protectors of the Holy Angels Church. The Bozos: When they first appeared, the Bozos were a prankster gang. Biosculpted to look like circus clowns with red bulbous noses, wild red hair, and long flat feet (no, not shoes) and costumed to the part, the Bozos became impromptu slapstick. But soon the Bozos became the ultimate killer clown gang. People living on Bozo turf learned the hard way that if you see a pack of Bozos, just run. Bozos enjoy playing on people's greatest fears: lurking in apartments in the dark, locking victims in small spaces filled with rats, stopping elevators midway and filling them with water. They are not funny. Inquisitors: The Inquisitors are a cult gang; like the hate gangs, they center on a specific ideology, in this case, religious. The Inquisitors think cyberware is blasphemous, and think nothing of tearing it right out of your body. They consider this \"saving\" your soul. Not only do they believe that cybernetics are \"evil,\" but they also have a war going on with every other gang in the city. Everyone hates these guys. Iron Sights: The Iron Sights are a relatively small, but surprisingly tough, combat gang of borderline cyberpsychos. Once funded by Arasaka, they fell on hard times after the War. But word on The Street is that they have a new benefactor and are once more flexing their Rippers. Maelstrom: This combat gang formed around the remnants of the old Metal Warriors; a gang virtu- ally wiped out in one night by the Inquisitors. It later drafted members of the Red Chrome Legion and lron Sights who also had violent personal grudges against the Inquisitors. Post-War, Maelstrom settled another long running feud with a smaller gang of cyberpsychos and began to adopt some of their old rival's meat-hating philosophies, leading to an almost exponential increase in visible and extreme cyberware among gang members. This, in turn, has only increased the number and intensity of the battles between Maelstrom and the Inquisitors. Despite years of rumors, no one has ever confirmed the existence of \"the Great Bozo\", the supposed leader of the Bozos. You never know who might be an Inquisitor. They often hide their gang robes when they're doing their day job. 309 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY Philharmonic Vampyres: The Vamps are a prankster gang who were dubbed the \"Philharmonic Vampyres\" a few decades ago when five members clad in tuxedos, capes, and vampire teeth flew up on wires behind the Night City Symphony on Halloween night. Are they artists, hoodlums, or social com- mentators? Are those teeth part of the costume or not? Who knows? Piranhas: The Piranhas are a typical party gang. They party, drink Smash, take and deal drugs, and mug people, all as part of a \"just because\" lifestyle. To these guys, the Party is everything. The Prime-Time Players: The Players are a poser gang who use biosculpting to look like members of old sitcoms and TV shows from bygone eras. They are an extended family gang which protects their neighborhood and longs for a bygone time. The Players are broken up into a number of different factions based on various shows. They are territorial and fiercely protective of their members. Reckoners: The Reckoners are one of several apocalyptic cults that sprung up after the War. They roam the streets, preaching the coming Harvest of Souls, recruiting from the homeless, and looking for donations, often taken from your unconscious body. A few are serious crazies who want to evoke the End Times right now with blood and C4. Red Chrome Legion: The Legion is a neo-fascist hate gang; young people united around various hate group ideologies. Uniforms and militaristic slogans are the rule. The Red Chromers will attack anything that they think isn't \"right.\" Scavvers: Scavengers aren't a gang per se, but the desperate homeless who squat in the ruined City Zones left behind by the War. They scour the treacherous debris for salable items such as copper, platinum, old tech, and even abandoned weapons. Many die doing so. Not least of all because these urban battlegrounds have been pretty picked over in the last seventeen years, and scavvers are constantly forced to dig deeper and deeper into unsafe terrain for anything of value. Steel Vaqueros: A Nomad pack out of Salinas, their ragtag convoys make the coastal highway run from the Santa Cruz agriplots to the southern cities. They take in anyone who displays skill, dependability, and who can keep up. Smart and relatively honest, they have supply deals with several Reclaimer groups in Night City. Tyger Claws: Once under the thumb of Arasaka, the Tyger Claws have broken away and become a dangerous pro- tector gang for the Asian community of Night City. They have had a significant role in rebuilding the sections of Japan Town after the 4th Corporate War. The Tyger Claws are known for their fast bikes, enhanced reflexes, and killer martial arts. Voodoo Boys: Major crime contacts in Florida and the Caribbean may have been the beginning of the Voodoo Boys, a terrorist gang with ritual magic overtones, feeding their bizarre tastes by dealing primarily non-synthetic drugs. But that's been changing recently, as real Haitians and other ref- ugees from the decimated Dominican Republic have started to move into the area. These immigrants have taken offense at the so-called Voodoo Boys and have taken to expressing their displeasure by maiming victims and dissecting the dead with machetes, leaving body parts as warnings. Stay tuned. where's [GanG x]? E ven bef ore t he 4t h Corporate War, gangs lived and died in a cycle of bloody violence. It wasn't uncommon for a gang to die after a single orgy of destruction, at the hands of a rival, or as a result of Corporate reprisal. In the aftermath of the Night City holocaust, a lot of gangs just fell apart in the chaos. The DJs scattered to the wind, a lot of Brainiacs fell victim to R.A.B.I.D.S, and most of the Wild Things died fighting Militech soldiers. Of course, there's always a chance a survivor's alive to start over again, or a new ganger decides to pick up some cred by adopting an old name and motif. If you've got a favorite gang from previous edi- tions and you don't see them on this list, feel free to throw them into the mix. Night City's a big place and there's plenty of room for a new gang or two. 310 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITYNIGHT CITY CIRCA 2045 K ey Places in and Around Night City Following are some of the major attractions and locations of Night City. hot Zone 1. Totentanz: This bar at the edge of the Hot Zone is well-known as a place to find boostergangs. They all seem to congregate here, but they don't come to dance. It's considered a bad night if the body count is under twenty. 311 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY RebuilDinG uRbAn CenteR ▶ The Glen ◀ 2. 1st Night City Bank: The main artery of business in Night City. The first floor of the building is a publicly accessible old-school, marble-floored banking institution, complete with friendly bank tellers, and red velvet queue lines. The real money is stored in the vault on the second floor, and between these floors there is restricted access. 3. City Hall: The seat of local government in Night City. Despite everything, the number of lobbyists, special interest groups, and government employees buzzing in this location has not decreased. 4. City Police Precinct #1: Straddling the line between the Glen and the Combat Zones, Precinct #1 is the first line of defense against the boosters and cyberpsychos of the Combat Zones and they watch that border with an eagle eye and a quick trigger. 5. Club Atlantis: A glamorous, multi-level club popular with Execs for its flashy, avant-garde, and disorienting style, highlighted by moving staircases, mirrored walls, and cool cerulean lighting. 6. Hall of Justice: The courthouse and jail, an imposing brutalist structure, designed to intimidate with its oversized towers and black steel doors complete with portcullis, was opened to the public on the same day as the neighboring City Hall. 7. Merrill, Asukaga & Finch Offices: The Merrill, Asukaga & Finch offices are located in the top floors of a centrally located skyscraper. Access to these floors is restricted to those with an appointment. Generally, they aren't taking new clients, except by referral. 8. Raven Microcybernetics: Raven Microcyb's new offices are located in a relatively unadorned corporate skyscraper. While they own the building, their offices only make up the top 10 floors. The rest is dedicated to housing their close business partners. ▶ University District ◀ 9. Biotechnica Campus: Biotechnica's offices are found on the edge of the University District. Geodesic dome greenhouses dot the property and its rooftop terraces give it a unique look. One dome is open to the public, as a living museum of natural and company history. Strange sounds can be heard from the campus at night. 10. Night City University: A college campus built up into more of a fortified monastery after many assaults by Boosters, NCU is the center of higher learning in the City and the only opportunity for non-Corpo kids to get a higher education. ▶ Little Europe ◀ 11. Camden Court: A highly reinforced, ritzy apartment complex on the north side, the Court is favored by Solos for its truly staggering physical and NET security—only a madperson would try to break into Camden Court without a full Corporate assault team. 12. Continental Brands Offices: The Continental Brands offices are located in one of Night City's newest skyscrapers. The first few floors house the Oasis Megamart, where you can shop for the most obscure flavors of Kibble, tour the Oasis Test Kitchen, or attend a Cooking with Kibble class. The upper floors are exclusively drab offices and the occasional chemical lab. 13. Danger Girl Offices: The Danger Girl offices are found in a stately thirteen story art deco building capped by a decorative clock tower. Inside, you'll find thirteen floors of hot pink shag flooring, stuffed mascot characters, smiling cat girls, model robots, shrines to J-pop groups, and brightly colored guns. Some of the Corps are working hard towards a day when Night City has a full central government again. That's why they funded the Glen's construction. 312 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY 14. Holy Angels Church: A three story, Roman Catholic church run by Father Kevin, which provides sanctuary and spiritual guidance to anyone who is willing to lay down their weapons and talk peacefully. 15. Night City Firestation #2: A large, fortified fire station which deploys cybered-up firefighting teams to deal with accidental fires in the Rebuilding Urban Zone and arson cases at the edge of the Combat Zones. 16. Short Circuit: A favorite haunt of Techs and Netrunners, it's not uncommon to find patrons of this bar hauling wrecked tech in from the Hot Zone to tinker with in the booths—Zhirafa drones at the door keep people from hauling in anything too dangerous. ▶ Upper Marina ◀ 17. City Medical Center: The City Medical Center is a large research hospital with multiple Corporate ties. Aside from offering medical care to the citizens of Night City, the hospital is also known for offering therapy and biosculpting, assuming you've got the eb of course. 18. McCartney Field Stadium: A Corporate-sponsored, 75,000-seat stadium home to Night City's many local teams: The Night City Slammers (Baseball), The Night City Rangers (Football), The Night City Heat (Basketball), and The Night City Death Dealers (Combat Soccer). 19. REO Meatwagon Offices: REO Meatwagon, a small time rival of Trauma Team, has its offices near the Combat Zones. They still practice the questionable business model of \"meat jumping\", attempting to show up to a Trauma Team call before them to steal the client, charging them out the nose for medical treatment should they survive. 20. The Afterlife: The premiere Solo bar in Night City, built in the remains of an old morgue on the outskirts of the Hot Zone, and run by the legendary Solo, Rogue. Every Solo in the city dreams of getting a drink at the Afterlife named after them—even if it only happens post-mortem. 21. Ziggurat Offices: The Ziggurat offices are located in a impressive, curved skyscraper designed to soar above the bay and command attention. Public access is limited to the occasional press conference. ▶ Watson Development ◀ 22. City Police Precinct #3: A large, well-armed (and often paranoid) precinct, staffed by veteran officers and armed with Militech weaponry to help them keep the peace in the northside of Night City. 23. Petrochem Offices: Petrochem's offices are located across the street from their bitter corporate rival, SovOil. Aside from a small museum where you can learn about the storied history of petroleum and a gift shop, the compound is heavily defended and inaccessible to the public. i know it's hARD to unDeRstAnD i know it's hARD to unDeRstAnD in A PlACe like niGht City, kiD, in A PlACe like niGht City, kiD, but this is A but this is A holy plaCeholy plaCe. so, . so, eitheR ResPeCt the eitheR ResPeCt the sanCtitysanCtity oF my oF my ChuRCh oR you'll be ResPeCtinG the ChuRCh oR you'll be ResPeCtinG the sAnCtity oF my sAnCtity oF my fistsfists. youR ChoiCe.. youR ChoiCe. — Father kevin— Father kevin You can order a Johnny Silverhand at the Afterlife but, oddly, you can't order a Morgan Blackhand. 313 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY 24. SovOil Offices: SovOil's offices are located across the street from their bitter Corporate rival, Petrochem. While entirely inaccessible to the public, just beyond the gates of the compound, a variety of gaudy gilded statues and monoliths can be seen. 25. Trauma Team Tower: The Trauma Team Tower contains their own hospital exclu- sively for Trauma Team Executive clients, an AV-4 repair bay, and an air traffic control tower to manage the logistical chaos of it all. ▶ NorCal Military Base ◀ 26. Militech Offices: Militech's offices in Night City are located on the Norcal Military Base. Access to non-government personnel is restricted. Any meeting held with out- siders is in a secure building that sits between the two security checkpoints. ▶ Morro Rock ◀ 27. Orbital Air Massdriver: A tremendous construction site on the Morro Rock, put in place to build the first orbital massdriver in Night City. ▶ Pacifica Playground ◀ 28. Playland by the Sea: A Corporate-sponsored amusement park/vacation des- tination, which features thrilling braindance adventures, amazing theme park rides, Continental Brands food courts, and lots of Corporate security. Much of the park is in constant renovation. CombAt Zones ▶ Old Japantown ◀ 29. Crisis Medical Center: A no-questions asked medical center supplied with the most advanced technology and frequented by Edgerunner, Solos, and boosters alike, Crisis Medical is neutral ground for all factions. 30. Highcourt Plaza Hotel: A decidedly classy and well-defended hotel nestled between Old Japantown and Little China featuring glass elevators, excellent service, and 1920s decor. ▶ Little China ◀ 31. The Forlorn Hope: A small, exclusive Solo bar that caters primarily to veterans from the SouthAm and 4th Corporate Wars, serving as a home away from home to many of the City's most dangerous retired Solos. ▶ Old Combat Zone ◀ 32. Jesse James' Kosher Deli: A popular hangout for Nomads and Boosters alike, the deli's really more of a saloon with a nightly body count to rival the Totentanz—but for a small fortune you can get a pretty good corned beef on rye. ▶ South Night City ◀ 33. Medical Technologies: A small body bank on the waterfront that has avoided being pushed into the bay by specializing in growing replacement limbs to order as well as supplying cyberware to various boostergangs. your ciTy There’s no rule saying you need to play a game of Cyberpunk RED in Night City. You can set your game in Atlanta, Barcelona, Melbourne, Rio de Janeiro, or anywhere else in the world. Your game. Your choice. Make it your own. There’s also no rule saying you have to play in our version of Night City. If you’ve got an idea for a big Mediacorp to replace Net54, go for it! If you want there to be a popular noodle bar and hot springs in the Upper Marina, grab a marker and doodle it onto the map. The City you play in, be it Night City or some- where else, should be a living, breathing place. It should be just as much a Character as any NPC in the game. The best way to do that is to make that city, whatever it is, your own. Use our stuff, sure, but populate it with your own people, your own gangs, your own locations. Make it your City. 314 WELCOME TO NIGHT CITY 34. Savage Docs: A decently sized ripperdoc joint run by the 5 apprentices of the late Savage Doc and protected by the Yakuza and the Tyger Claws. 35. The Slammer: A popular ganger bar on the southside docks, known for its cinder block arena where boosters from all across the Combat Zones come to settle disputes with heavy fire power and bloody rippers. oveRPACkeD subuRbs ▶ Heywood (Santo Domingo) ◀ 36. Aldecaldo Camp: A large, multi-cultural encampment at the edge of the city where the Aldecaldo Nomads run an expansive trade and transport network, hiring themselves out to guide people across the badlands and transport goods just about anywhere. 37. City Police Precinct #2: A large and overworked police precinct which has to devote more than half its forces to dealing with gangs of scavvers and has come to rely on Zhirafa drones to patrol the vast expanse of the Overpacked Suburbs. 38. MetalStorm: A nearly indestructible bar, built under the bridge to central Night City, MetalStorm caters to chromers of all shapes and sizes, including a bunch of full body conversions who come to the bar to thrash and get plastered. Almost everything in this bar is solid metal, even the customers. ▶ Heywood Industrial Zone ◀ 39. Zhirafa Office Park: The Zhirafa offices were built on an existing factory park, building new floors right on top of the existing architecture and breathing new life into old interiors to make room for cozy cafeterias, innovation nooks, and at least one laser tag arena. Drones and animal mecha are often seen patrolling the office park. ▶ New Westbrook ◀ 40. Network 54 Offices: Even from across the bay, Network 54's public offices are an easily identifiable part of the skyline thanks to the neon 54 on the side of the building. The home of many popular shows taped before live studio audiences, the building is also home to its own clinic, restaurants, rec-center and housing exclusively for its stars, which aren't a part of the tour. 41. Night City Firestation #1: A well-supplied fire station at the edge of the bay which deploys AVs and firetrucks to fires across the Northern and Southern side of the City. 42. Rocklin Augmentics Campus: The Rocklin Augmentics offices are on a campus comprised of offices, meeting spaces, a cafeteria, and a hospital, connected via several skybridges to a second much larger concrete building home solely to research and development. 43. WorldSat Offices: The WorldSat Communications offices are located in New Westbrook atop a ridge which boosts the range of their main communications tower, located on-site. Being located relatively close to the outskirts of Night City, the compound is heavily defended. Nomads control a number of points of entry into Night City but the Aldecaldo Camp is where they like to do business. thAt's the thAt's the thirdthird CoRP muRDeR this week!

You're a Family member and I wouldn't be a good member of the Pack if I didn't take care of a brother. So, let me fill you in on how they do things in Big Bad Night City. Trace Santiago 316 EVERYDAY LIFE Staying out of Trouble the lAw Let's start with the cops (which is the first thing you're gonna need to know in the City). First of all, most are now called Lawmen, since their ambit covers a lot more than the old school City Beat. The Lawmen of the Time of the Red are organized much as they were during the 20th century with Homicide, Vice, Burglary, and Traffic Squads; about 5 men each. The most recent addition to police organization has been the addition of the Cyberpsycho Squad (also known as the Psycho Squad), whose main job is to deal with cybernetic criminals. While the average beat cop hits The Street in an armored squad car, wearing an armor jacket, helmet, and carrying a smart-chipped Minami-10 sidearm, the Psycho Squad detail employs aerogyros, AV-4s, miniguns, assault weapons, and Stinger missile launchers. City cops can patrol all areas of the city. Corporate Cops are deputized to patrol only corporate facili- ties. However, in areas where a large number of office areas are huddled together, this effectively can turn an entire downtown region into Corporate Cop territory. Corporate Cops are usually better armed and armored, and often have full Trauma Team medical coverage. They are also more vicious, sadistic, and likely to shoot first—after all, they know the Corporation can cover up any incidents. There are also Lawmen on the open highways as well. Since a lot of new Reclaimed Cities don't have police forces set up yet, these wandering marshals are much like the range-riding Wyatt Earps of the Old West—hard riding, fast shooting—part of why they are colloquially all lumped under the Old Western/ Roaring '20s tag of \"Lawmen.\" the leGAlities Skyrocketing crime rates in the 1990s proved the existing legal structure was falling apart. Following the Purge of 1996 (when citizens' groups lynched hundreds of criminal defense lawyers), the government declared martial law throughout the United States for a period of three years. During this time, justice was dispensed by local military courts. JustiCe, ARmy style During the martial law period that began in the late 1990s, the U.S. government looked to military regulations to replace the laws that had previously governed the nation. As a result, the Military Justice Code became the main rule of U.S. law. The Code's draconian standards of crime and pun- ishment served so well, in the eyes of those in power, that when martial law was suspended the government established a Uniform Civilian Justice Code in its place. Some loosening of restrictions was seen in the early 2020s but, in the aftermath of the 4th Corp War, the Uniform Civilian Justice Code is once again the law of the land. Even Night City, which isn't part of the New United States, still bases what laws it actually has on the Uniform Civilian Justice Code. Of course, how much the laws get enforced depends entirely on what part of the City you're in and what your annual income is. Funny how, no matter how harsh the laws get, the rich still manage to get away with murder. Sometimes literally. CRime... Theft, Fraud, and Stealing If theft is defined as taking something that isn't yours, there's a lot of thieving going on in Night City. Too much to account for, in fact. Stealing gets you food when you're starving, weapons when you're under attack, safe places when you're living in a dumpster, and money to pay other people to cover you when you're not powerful enough to do it for yourself. If the Lawmen really buckled down and tried to bust every person in Night City who stole something, they'd be at it 24-7. And there just aren't enough Lawmen out there for that. No, in general, The Street deals with theft in its own way. If you get caught, the only question becomes how bad can the victim mess you up. Sometimes you just get a beating. Sometimes you get hunted down like a dog and flat out killed (assuming the victim doesn't fit in a bit of torture just for laughs before they kill you). If you steal from a Corp, chances are you'll 317 EVERYDAY LIFE just end up back on The Street with your frontal lobes burned out or parted out into the local body bank. These things have a way of working out long before any Lawman comes on the scene. Fraud? Between the bunko rackets and scams, the confidence schemes and creative bookkeeping, fraud is a way of life on The Street. But remember that if your Corp finds out their new Exec is cooking the books or stealing under the table, you're going to only wish you were dead. The Corps are actually pretty legal about these things; they'll hand what's left of you to the authorities ... eventually. Assuming you get lucky and stand trial for what The Street considers to be a non-issue, you'll be lucky to get off with a little electroflogging, long term exile, or a year or two of braindance. Just sayin'... ▶ Drugs ◀ Theoretically, narcotics may not be possessed within the premises of the United States. However, bio-engi- neered plant diseases developed through the 1990s by the Drug Enforcement Agency wiped out 96% of the coca and opium plants in existence, making the point moot. The law also does not cover \"designer drugs\" such as endorphins, which are defined as medicinal. Besides, you're in Night City. It's not part of the United States anymore, choomba. Smoke 'em if ya got em. ▶ Rape and Assault ◀ In the Time of the Red, there's not much difference between rape and other physical assaults—at least as far as The Street sees it. If you can't take vengeance on your attacker yourself, there are plenty of Solos or other guns for hire who will gladly find you some Street justice. Most of the time, there's no trial other than what you and your allies can put together, although the Laws will usually take a hand if you ask them; they figure some scav who harms others is probably going to move up to even more heinous crimes sooner or later, so they might as well slam their ass into a cell on the way to a legally sanctioned punishment now. On the other hand, don't even think about assaulting or raping a Nomad. They usually just drag you behind the nearest vehicle until you're hamburger. You don't even want to guess where they tie the rope. ▶ Murder vs. Self-Defense ◀ Self-defense is defined as \"any instance in which the assailant can show just cause that his or her life, or the life of another party, was threatened in circumstances where a duly-appointed officer of the law could not be summoned, or where it was impossible to restrain the injured party by any other means.\" There is a lot of murder on The Street. Sometimes the Lawmen get involved. Sometimes you can get someone to inves- tigate someone else's murder. But in general, if you have a weapon and they had a weapon, The Street considers it self-defense and whoever died probably deserved it. ...AnD Punishment Nailed for a Crime? The punishment for criminal actions under the Uniform Justice Code of 1999 are swift, certain, and draconian. Plea bargaining (plead- ing guilty to a lesser charge to speed up a trial) has been eliminated. Probation is almost unheard of. The death penalty is standard for murder cases—there is a 3-month appeal process during which new evidence can be produced. Most felonies have mandatory prison terms of five to ten years. Lesser crimes are covered by a number of unpleasant forms of punish- ment that make prison sound pretty good.BY NEIL BRANQUINHO 318 EVERYDAY LIFE ▶ Personality Adjustment ◀ The simplest punishment is personality adjustment—a process which implants an aversion to committing the crime ever again. Adjustment has some nasty side effects, including exaggerated fears of situations and events related to the crime (such as a terror of money based on an anti-robbery adjustment). ▶ Electroflogging ◀ Unless you're into serious S&M action, you're not going to enjoy this one. Being tied to a large X-shaped cross while the State Executioner (or the local equivalent) tears your back apart with an electrified metal whip is probably something you're not going to enjoy. Ten lashes are usually enough to kill most people. But for minor crimes, you'll probably get off with only three. ▶ Exile ◀ Exile implants are keyed to a transmission signal broadcast through the city phone NET. If the offender enters the city, the implant causes excru- ciating pain. The offender is effectively exiled from ever entering that specific city again. Repeat offenses in other cities simply cause additional city codes to be added to the implant. After enough crimes in enough cities, the offender will be unable to enter civilization again. ▶ Prison Blues ◀ Prisons of the 2000s are horrendously overcrowded and deadly. After the riots of the '90s, prison author- ities couldn't care less about rehabilitation—they're mostly interested in penning up society's \"mad dogs\" and keeping the streets clear. Most prisoners are rel- egated to Low Security Blocks. Low Security Blocks are containment facilities for petty criminals and those convicted of moderate offenses. Prisoners often share cells with one or more other prisoners. In many ways, Low Security facilities are very similar to prisons of the late 20th century. They're staffed by prison guards, either private or Corporate, who will not hesitate to shoot criminals who become a nuisance. Most prisoners are short-term; long- term prisoners can become Trustees and may even be deputized and allowed access to non-lethal weapons if their psych reports permit this. Low Security inmates are often required to work diligently at menial tasks. This can be likened to the chain gangs of long ago, where prisoners were worked so hard that they didn't have the energy to cause trouble. Some Low Security facilities maintain dor- mitories instead of cells. Then there's Top Security. Top Security provides containment facilities for the baddest offenders. Most are locked down almost all of the time. Interpersonal interactions between inmates is forbidden. You do time in Top and you're on your own—for the duration. Automated sentries guard perps around the clock and no infringement of security is allowed—under penalty of death. lnmates come into contact with guards and other authorized personnel only when undergoing treatment of some kind. ▶ Braindance ◀ To cope with overcrowding, many prisons force inmates into \"braindance\"—they are placed in cryotanks, wired to interface loop programs, and \"shut down\" for periods of two or three years. Continuous braindance creates a nightmare of unending, bland horror, making it the thing cons fear most. Although Braindance therapy is often a common component of a criminal's sentence, most will do anything to avoid it. Although the body is cooled and no physical exertion is possible, the perp's mind is fully active for the duration of the session. All they can really \"see\" is the endless blackness of total sensory deprivation. Fifteen years or more of this will cause even the most hardened perp to beg for a different sentence. But guards are on hand to deal with any difficulties that may arise from this. Braindance is also seen as an excellent way of getting difficult prisoners out of the way in lieu of exe- cutions (which are not always good for public relations). ▶ Bang—You've Got Justice ◀ The simplest method of punishment is still execution. Most states have a State Executioner who administers justice with one well-placed .44 slug at point-blank range. They are also empowered to hunt down escap- ees from Death Row. All this is assuming you even make it to prison. A lot of security forces shoot first and fill out fatal incident reports later.BY RICHARD BAGNALL 319 EVERYDAY LIFE H ow You Stay in Touch meet youR AGent In the Time of the Red, the cell phone of the 2000s has been replaced by a device a generational step beyond its predecessors.

It's not a true AI, but rather a set of interlocking pro- grams that manage data and \"learn\" how to do things by interacting with its owner. This allows the Agent to manage your life—to make sure you have the time to do what you need instead of going to the store or washing the laundry. ▶ What Your Agent Can Do ◀ Let's start with basic \"phone\" functions. Sure, you can use your Agent to make phone calls in voice, or flatscreen. You can record your calls, forward them, or even put them on answer mode. But why stop there? Like a real agent, your Agent can also manage your calls. If you're trying to locate a person, your Agent will not only scan the local Data Pool to get their location from their Agent but can also place the call for you. If you don't have time to talk, it can generate a realistic talking headshot of you compiled from the times you've used it; the headshot can deliver mes- sages or act as an answering machine. Your Agent can also screen your calls, tailoring the headshot's response to each caller as needed (nice for a client, nasty for a solicitor) and telling you what's been done in each case, using one of the hundreds of possible downloadable \"voices\" it can access for itself. Finally, your Agent can send or receive text mes- sages as well as download screamsheet (news) updates keyed to particular subjects you want to keep track of. Need to buy an Agent? Check out page 351. A lot of people also use old- fashioned flip phones. They're cheap, making them easy to dump if you're worried about being traced. 320 EVERYDAY LIFE ▶ Getting Personal ◀ Your Agent is also your backup memory. Not only can it keep appointments for you like an organizer, but it can act on them. Let's say you have an anniversary. Tell the Agent the person and date. Not only will it remind you, but you can set it up to scan its personal data base on the person in question and use the data to pick out a gift. It'll ask you ahead of time if the gift would be acceptable; if it is, the Agent orders the gift, pays for it out of your cred account, and has it delivered to the recipient—all via the Data Pool. Your Agent also acts as a portable \"farley file\"—compiling information about the people you associate with, either by noting your interactions with them, or by interrogating their Agents to ask for data (like phone numbers or personal preferences). ▶ Let's Get Even More Personal ◀ Your Agent doesn't have to be a lifeless tool. With upgrades, you can give it a surrogate personality with a name, voice, and even a avatar in the form of a face and body. You can call it by name, ask it to do things, or even set it to call you and talk to you as though it were a real person. Some lonely souls stationed on distant transport runs or orbital stations have been known to reprogram their Agents to act as surrogate lovers as well as personal assistants (with the aid of specific cybernetically driven \"enhancements\" to meet very specific needs). ▶ Database ◀ Need information? Forget using a Data Term. Your Agent has autonomous search functions that let it do research for you. Ask your Agent to find you informa- tion on a topic, and it cruises the Data Pool looking for facts. It can compile those facts into a simplified report format (you choose the report parameters) that can be delivered through text, graphics, or voice. Your Agent can also scan the Data Pool to locate a person, place, or thing. You can tell it to display the result as a map, a GPS guide, or a vocal file. ▶ Lifestyle Manager ◀ Your Agent can be linked to most of the appliances in your Conapt. It talks to your fridge and your cup- boards to ask them if you need food; if you're running out of items on your shopping list it can be set to order more supplies and have them delivered to your door. It even talks to the toilet paper roller to make sure you never run out. You can hook your Agent up to talk to your clothes—the digital fabric tells your Agent when it's getting worn out, lets the Agent know what it is, where it was purchased, and from where to order a replacement. You can hook your Agent into most of the devices in your life: if your fancar needs maintenance, it'll schedule an appointment with the mechanic; if your weapons need cleaning or repairs, it'll tell you that, too. The Agent even monitors your body signs if you ask; if you're wounded, it can scan your body and call the Trauma Team if you link it to a Biomonitor. ▶ Entertainment ◀ Your Agent is also your main entertainment conduit. Forget about lugging around those old-school music players, MPEG pods, or entertainment dataslivers. Your Agent can store thousands of hours of program- ming: music, video, movies, games. It can display them on its own onboard LCD or automatically seek out any unused video/audio screen in the area and project its programming though that. With digital fabrics, it can even project your favorite entertainment onto your clothes. Your Agent takes note of the entertainment programs you watch; after the second time you watch, your Agent will automatically download future episodes for you from the DP. It'll also keep track of similar kinds of programs and flag a sample episode for you to watch. And if its storage memory gets overloaded, it can automatically download unused data into backup memory modules (which it can buy and have delivered to your Conapt) where it can access them at any time. ▶ What Your Agent Can Carry ◀ While not fully functional computers, Agents do have access to many computer program functions as well. They can word process using voice or a Virtuality keyboard, downloading the output to Data Pool or a hardcopy printer. They can record images in 2- or 3D (depending on the model) and upload the images to the Data Pool. Onboard programs can be used to mix music, create special effects, even generate CGI imagery. With links to flop-screens and music synths, you can even use an Agent to play a gig. Feel free to assign your Agent a name and even a personality. They can make fun NPCs during a game! Ziggurat's Ask Alex Anything app is specially designed to work with Agents for Data Pool searches. 321 EVERYDAY LIFE In short, having an Agent is like having a personal secretary equipped with a phone, TV, recording studio, entertainment system, computer, medical alert button, personal organizer, and online shopping service all in a box about the size of a pack of cigarettes. ▶ Agency and Data Pool Links ◀ But all this power isn't much use without a hookup, neh? And that means Agency. You'll need a service provider to sell you that Agency-connectivity. No one company owns connectivity; there are millions of providers and new ones rezzing in every day. They put up a few wireless nodes and link cheater software into the existing nodes that are already active. No one owns all the nodes, but since every new node simply increases the reach, existing providers are happy to let new guys link in. The cost of your Agency is included in any Lifestyle. W hat You're Packing By 1997, even the most well-intentioned gun-control statutes were buried under a wave of public protest as crime rates made America a siege state. Self-defense soon became an American lifestyle, and there was an explosive increase in light personal protection weapons. By 1999, most gun-control statutes involved 1) filling out a \"carry application\" allowing you to carry a con- cealed handgun; 2) waiting four days for an extensive background check and approval, which could be refused on the basis of a criminal record or history of mental illness; and 3) paying the 25eb fee and having a serial number laser etched into the butt of the gun. This number is cataloged with the ballistics firing pattern of your weapon at FBI/CIA Headquarters in Washington D.C. Everyone pretty much ignores all of the above. the Rules The Federal Weapons Statute of 1999 states that if a gun with your ID number is used in the com- mission a crime, you are liable for that crime unless you have previously reported the weapon as lost or stolen and have had this report filed with your local police agency. Under the provisions of the Federal Weapons Statute, it is not legal to carry submachine guns and other fully automatic weapons; possession carries a stiff five- to seven-year mandatory prison sentence. Not that this stops anyone. GettinG the GooDs Where do you get weapons? There aren't any Militech showrooms these days. But any decent Fixer can hook you up at the local Night Market. There are a ton of options—after all, there was a war just a few years ago—but you'll have to take potluck. Who knows? You might score an old Malorian, or a classic wheellock. olD Guns still woRk There are still more than enough used models of ven- erable Berettas and Webleys for sale (particularly in Night Markets), and large numbers of \"obsolete\" weapons can be found at reasonable prices in any pawn shop. The tough part is finding ammunition; most modern guns are now caseless and if you have an old gun, you're going to have to load your own. militARy suRPlus One result of massive conventional war spanning five continents is that in the end there's going to be a lot of surplus and abandoned hardware just lying around. Handguns, rifles, fully automatic weapons, handheld missile launchers, flamethrowers—you're going to be spoiled for choice. If your Fixer can find it, you can prob- ably buy it—and get the caseless ammo that fits it to boot. moDeRn stuFF While there's a certain panache in using an old model sidearm like a Colt .357 or .45, the sensible Cyberpunk knows that a modern pistol makes a good backup. Since the introduction of the Glock 17 automatic in the mid-1980s, most major handgun manufacturers now produce polymer resin pistols in a variety of calibers. PolymeR one-shots The most ubiquitous of these weapons are the various models of polymer plastic handguns (Poor Quality Pistols). Easily created using 3D printing, they're cheap 322 EVERYDAY LIFE and available even from some Vendit machines. Manufactured in a variety of bright, designer colors, these so-called \"Polymer One-Shots\" come with easy -to-load caseless ammunition, retail at cheaper prices and are available in most Oasis Convenience stores. They combine practicality, durability, and style in potent little packages. The now dated Cyberteen™ line includes airbrushed casings with colorful shapes and artwork molded right in—the perfect gift for the young consumer interested in personal defense. Ammo No matter the type, most modern guns are primarily designed to use a specific class of ammunition based on the size of the gun. These are grouped by fire- power: Light (equivalent to 6mm), Medium (9mm), Heavy (11mm), and Very Heavy (12mm) types. Generally, rifles fire a standardized round (based on the 7.62x39mm), allowing almost any local Tech to produce ammunition as needed. H ow You Get Around Surprise, surprise. Contrary to expectations, the Dark Future has not yielded any staggering new develop- ments in transportation. Years of economic strife and civil unrest have discouraged research into new ways to travel—in fact, the very act of travel has become very restricted. Don't expect the inner-city world of the Time of the Red to be much like the 20th century—a network of crowded freeways, packed trains, and swarming airports. Instead, think of it as a patchwork of badly up-kept roads, abandoned airports, and trains plagued by gangs and intermittent service. GRounD tRAnsPoRt ▶ GRounDCARs Various manufacturers • Powerplant: CHOOH2 or methane-fueled internal combustion • Top Groundspeed: 100 to 300 MPH, depend- ing on model • Structural Damage Points: 50 • Cost: Varies depending on model There haven't been any major changes in automobiles since the 1980s—externally. Most cars are still basi- cally a box on wheels, with smooth or hard edges. The Cyberpunk ethos being, \"If it works, keep it til it doesn't work.\" In the cash poor environment of the 2000s, auto manufacturers have kept to conservative, unimaginative designs, so that by today the average family car is little changed from its practically antique roots. With the extremely high price of petroleum, almost all cars of the 2000s are powered by tanks of liquefied methane or meta-alcohol fuels such as CHOOH 2. Electric cars are the exception, not the rule, simply because the infrastructure for rapid charging is non-existent. ▶ CybeRCARs Cybercar control systems are roughly like those of the late 20th century but employ a few more digital displays and push-button controls. In addition to BY HUNTANG 323 EVERYDAY LIFE control, most cars offer cybernetic control systems. These systems employ servos at the wheels, throttle, and transmission, which are controlled by a modified cybermodem in the dash. The driver simply \"studs\" their Interface Plugs into the cybermodem and thinks the car through the motions. Vehicles without external controls are relatively uncommon, as the removal of external controls renders the vehicle useless to anyone but a cybered driver. So far, no major manufacturer has produced a purely cyber-driven automobile, although there are several after-market firms which will convert a car purely to cyber control. ▶ CybeRbikes Various manufacturers • Powerplant: CHOOH 2 or hydro-fueled internal combustion • Top Groundspeed: 100 to 300 MPH, depend- ing on model • Structural Damage Points: 35 • Cost: Varies depending on model There's a huge number of bikes and trikes out there these days as well. Most are hydro or CHOOH2 fueled. Models include Kundalini, Harlon-Dawson, Zondo, and Toyo-Tomo. seA tRAnsPoRt ▶ sPeeDboAts Various manufacturers • Powerplant: CHOOH 2 or hydro-fueled internal combustion • Top Surface Speed: 60 MPH • Structural Damage Points: 50 • Cost: 30,000eb (Super Luxury) Any one of a number of small, light, mono-hulled per- formance craft designed for smuggling, rescue, law enforcement ops, piracy, or (rarely) water-skiing. Hulls are made primarily of a flexible dense polymer with titanium reinforcement. Common upgrades include onboard machine guns and other heavy weapons. ▶ oteC hAmmeRheAD multiPuRPose minisub • Powerplant: Battery, CHOOH 2 propulsion • Top Surface Speed: 15 MPH (10 MOVE) • Top Submerged Speed: 60 MPH (20 MOVE) • Structural Damage Points: 100 • Crew: 3-8 The Hammerhead is an example of most \"taxi\" subs used throughout the oceans. Employed as a long- range shuttlesub, it was never intended for combat and has a notoriously \"dirty\" silhouette which makes it easy to spot on sonar. Still, it is functional and flexible, with two onboard Pseudo-AIs to assist the pilot and crew in their tasks. Despite its apparent lack of combat utility, some have been armed with twin rocket pods and pushed into the fray as stop-gap patrol subs. Those who pilot these \"torp-tubs\" have developed a standard tactic of firing their torpedoes at any hostile bogey as soon as it enters their weapon's maximum range. They then turn and run back to their bases, avoiding any possible close encounter with undoubtedly better-equipped foes. AiR tRAnsPoRt ▶ GyRoCoPteRs Various manufacturers • Powerplant: CHOOH²-powered rotary aircraft engine • Operational Radius: 50 Miles • Top Airspeed: 100 MPH • Structural Damage Points: 35. • Cost: 20,000eb (Super Luxury) The riots of the late '90s required new tactics for operating in urban areas. Chief among these was the introduction of light, low passenger helicopters or \"gyrocopters.\" Currently used by police units, Corporate defense teams, Solo assault operations teams, and drug-run- ning gangs. Unarmed versions are popular as recre- ational vehicles. To find out how Vehicle Combat works see page 189. 324 EVERYDAY LIFE ▶ heliCoPteRs Various manufacturers • Powerplant: CHOOH²-powered turboshaft engine gas turbine • Operational Radius: 600 Miles • Top Airspeed: 200 MPH • Structural Damage Points: 60 • Cost: 50,000eb (Super Luxury) Most helicopters mount two large, wide-propped engine nacelles at the ends of long, high-lift wings. The engines can be tilted from a forward-facing direction to a vertical position, allowing the aircraft to take off and hover vertically. The wings can also be folded back along the body for easy storage, making them a perfect vehicle to launch from rooftop helipads and airstrips. A revolutionary concept when it was unveiled in 1988, the tilt rotor aircraft has become a standard vehicle throughout the 2000s. The military version served with distinction throughout the riots of the '90s and the Central American Conflicts. Various civilian manufacturers have licensed the tilt-rotor design and applied it to smaller commercial and business applications. Helicopters are used as commuter vehicles for trips between city centers and hub airports, or as Corporate aircraft operating from rooftop pads atop starscrapers. Small versions such as the AE-800 Featherlite are popular light aircraft throughout the world, allowing flight operations in even the most remote and unprepared sites. ▶ Av-4 multiPuRPose AeRoDynes Various manufacturers • Powerplant: Single vectored thrust turbofan • Operational Radius: 400 Miles • Top Airspeed: 200 MPH • Structural Damage Points: 100 • Price: 50,000eb (Super Luxury) The nearest thing to a science-fiction jet-car, the AV-4 was originally developed as a light assault aircraft capable of operation in close urban areas where rotary and tiltwing aircraft cannot penetrate. Short, bulbous, and equipped with only rudimentary maneu- ver wings, the AV-4 has the aerodynamic character- istics of a rock, relying on the brute force of its huge jet engine to keep it aloft (the original engine lifted a 19,550 lb. jumpjet, while a fully loaded AV-4 weighs about 8,600 lbs). The AV-4 is used by police or Corporate troops for urban assault after being upgraded with a bel- ly-mounted onboard machine gun. They are also used as emergency vehicles by the Trauma Team, and as Corporate vehicles for making special deliveries. The most common upgrade made to an AV-4 is to armor its chassis. ▶ Av-9 suPeR AeRoDynes Various manufacturers • Powerplant: Twin vectored thrust turbofans • Operational Radius: 400 Miles • Max Airspeed: 300 MPH • Structural Damage Points: 60 • Cost: 100,000eb (Super Luxury) A relatively recent development of the AV class, these are smaller aerodynes designed to fulfill the role of a sports car, with twin vectored thrust turbofans mounted in heavily armored side housings. In addition to the increase in thrust provided by the second fan, the reduction in weight gained from its minimal cabin allows the AV-9 to scream through the air at extreme speeds. They are primarily purchased for recreation by the wealthy, but a select few on the street have found their own uses for them. oRbitAl tRAnsPoRt ▶ DeltA 4 sPACePlAne • Powerplant: Batteries, Hi-Lox fuel cells • Top Airspeed: Mach 6 • Structural Damage Points: 40 • Crew: 1-2 A holdover from the 4th Corp War, Deltas are high- speed, suborbital spaceplanes designed for combat and interception. They usually have two engines: a 325 EVERYDAY LIFE normal supersonic jet for reaching an altitude of 35,000 m/yds, and a solid-fueled rocket engine for boosting into orbit. Occasionally, deltas are carried piggyback by larger jet aircraft, or boosted into orbit by using disposable rockets. They can also be carried aboard deep space craft. Once in orbit, deltas use maneuver thrusters to move in on orbital targets. Well-armed with twin smart rocket pods, deltas must strike quickly and then use their remaining fuel to reenter safely. Deltas are exceedingly rare; the EuroSpace Agency only had around 24, but recently discoveries of hidden space- plane attack wings stashed in remote airbases in the U.S. and the EuroTheatre have made them available to the most well-heeled Execs and Nomad Families through world-class Fixers. meGA vehiCles FoR mAximum tRAnsPoRt ▶ liGht RAil lev tRAin Various manufacturers • Powerplant: Electric third rail inductance field • Top Groundspeed: 300 MPH (60 MOVE) • Structural Damage Points: 100 per train car Superconductor magnets have made it possible to build extremely cheap and durable \"levitation trains.\" Riding on magnetic cushions, these \"levs\" have become one of the major transportation resources in the 2000s. Financed by Corporations or city govern- ments, they are present in most major cities. Levs are usually built underground within city limits, and run on high pillars out in the suburbs. Usually one line, headed out to the Executive Zone, is sealed off and requires an entry pass to get onto. Corporate lev stations are always clean, well-lit, and well-guarded by Corporate security. City lev stations are usually not up to these standards, although most cities run police patrols on the line to control crime and vandalism. Lev tickets are charged at a rate of 1eb per station passed; a trip passing through three stations, for example, would cost 3eb. Tickets may be purchased from automatic ticket machines using cash. These machines are located in the stations themselves and in local convenience store outlets. ▶ Cino RelACs CARGo sub • Powerplant: Battery, CHOOH 2 propulsion • Top Surface Speed: 15 MPH (10 MOVE) • Top Submerged Speed: 60 MPH (20 MOVE) • Structural Damage Points: 300 • Crew: 6-36 This cargo sub is perhaps the closest thing that any Nomad group will ever own that could hope to compare to the big governmental \"boomers.\" Over one hundred m/yds long and more than ten decks high, the ClNO cargo sub is the largest cargo sub- mersible currently in production, and is always oper- ated by a full Nomad clan. Designed by the Russians of the Neo-Sov, and affectionately known as the Really Exceptionally Large Cargo Sub (RELaCS), it is a fifty-year-old design that was refitted for the 2040s and beyond. A smooth hull layered with sound absorption tiles and oversized caterpillar drives makes the RELaCS an amazingly quiet sub (considering its size). Despite the ship's mass, it has a small crew and can be operated by only 6 people (depending heavily on its automated systems). Features include quad rocket pods and a Minisub bay, which these days typically houses a Hammerhead. ▶ k151 AeRoZeP • Powerplant: CHOOH 2 or hydro-fueled internal combustion • Top Airspeed: 100 MPH (20 MOVE) • Structural Damage Points: 300 • Crew: 2-36 Based on the pre-War U.S. Army's popular Overlord design, this Aerozep is now used primarily as a cargo hauler, redesigned to move up to ten cargo modules between staging areas. They are the primary heavy lift transports for aerial-based Nomad Families, and do not operate anywhere near a potential Combat Zone; they are always kept as far away as operationally possible, guarded by several fast-strike combat AVs or air-superiority fighters. The K151 can be piloted with a crew of 2, although this is rare; usually a K151 is the primary workhorse of a single Nomad Family with upwards of 30 people onboard, or sometimes more when cargo is not being carried. 326 EVERYDAY LIFE H OW YOU GET THE WORD DAtA teRm The Data Term is a street corner computer terminal, built into a heavily armored concrete post. Data Terms have a direct NET link to a central Data Term service in their home city and can provide maps of the area, information, news updates, phone numbers, current events, entertainment information, and shopping services. Data Terms may also be used to jack into the Data Pool. Rates are about 10eb (Cheap) per minute. Most Data Terms are operated by Ziggurat or a local DT service, which is often a subsidiary of a local newspaper or screamsheet publisher. sCReAmsheets To stay competitive with television, most newspapers now use digital technology. Entire pages are typeset and laid out by computer, photos scanned into place, and the entire newspaper reduced to digital code. This code is transmitted to hundreds of newspaper boxes all over the area. The newsboxes reassemble the code and print the paper (using high speed replication) on the spot. The result is a slick, flimsy newspaper known in streetslang as a screamsheet. Screamsheets have many advantages over previous newspapers. You can dial the newsbox to print only the sections of the paper you want, paying 0.1eb per page printed. New editions can be compiled in hours, allowing the public to keep abreast of a story even as it happens (although most screamsheets are updated at 6:00 a.m., 12:00 p.m., 5:00 p.m. and 10:00 p.m.). In addition, you can download a screamsheet to your Agent.

They also provide the format for most \"talk\" shows, as well as documentaries and informational programming—equivalent to the news anchors of the past. the DAtA Pool What makes PopMedia possible is the Data Pool—a Citywide LAN network that links the Red world together in lieu of the old NET. Usually built and main- tained by Ziggurat, each City has its own version of a Data Pool, requiring the user to set up an account in order to log on and use its facilities. Data Pools are also limited with their LAN structure, a requirement in a world where rampant NET sabo- tage is the rule—a hardwired system just doesn't have the same flexibility. Since the Data Pool is an open-ended database, anyone can readily drop new PopMedia program- ming into it, with new entries easily found by Agent search functions. Getting a new PopMedia download is as easy as clicking a link—and once you've loaded it into your Agent once, it'll keep downloading that media (or similar ones) until you say stop. PopMedia is also flexible and viral—since the Data Pool has integrated feedback, this means that it can track how many times a program is accessed and react accordingly. A PopMedia program may start out only occupying one time slot, but as subscribers mount and word gets around, it may end up dominating a huge percentage of the overall possible bandwidth. This also means that competing shows often find themselves battling for bandwidth, with small outfits going toe-to-toe (and gun-to-gun) with the giant Mediacorps that still remain. W hat You Wear Digital fabric integrates micro-circuitry into the weave of material, allowing the material to have other prop- erties than mere adornment and protection. Others have heating or cooling abilities to alleviate the summer heat or winter chill. Most buttons and zippers incorporate microcomputers to control these functions.

It is a mass-produced nutrient made primarily of kelp, plank- ton, and soy proteins (none of this \"Kibble is people!\" drek) that fulfills most nutritional requirements, but smells and tastes about as good as its canine name- sake. Neocorps often dispense this to laborers as part of their \"support\" programs (of course, the cost is deducted from their pay). Most people in the urban zones have at least one meal a day of kibble, but try to have something with more variety as their main meal, if they can afford it.BY EVE VENTRUE Find out more about how much fashions cost on page 356. 329 EVERYDAY LIFE ▶ Prepack ◀ The next step up is Prepack: meals that can be micro- waved or self-heated. They still tend to be largely soy and grain-based \"faux food,\" but they are usually fla- vored more effectively and may have a few bits of real meat or veggies in there. Good Prepack has a higher percentage of natural food and is rather like restaurant fare, just in a bag. You press the tab and it's \"heat and eat.\" A Prepack diet is significantly more expensive than kibble with Good Prepack pushing up the price still higher. Prepack is far more common in Executive and wealthy homes; if you want Prepack in Edgerunner turf, you'd better head out to a restaurant, choomba. FResh FooD Fresh food had always been standard fare for the City elite and a rare luxury for the average person, although some groups had an advantage in this area as they were living in environments where the food was processed. ▶ Guerrilla Gardening ◀ But right after the War, getting any kind of food into the Cities (and past the raiding gangs, the warring Megacorps, and the issues of just plain transportation) was nearly impossible. Faced with starvation, many Edgerunners suddenly developed green thumbs— tearing up previously abandoned lots and revealing the soil beneath—and transporting the materials to make rooftop gardens and water sprinkler systems powered by the intermittent rains. Within a couple years post-War, there were a lot of gardening sites that were small, carefully tended, and feeding the populations of local Conapts and neighborhood squats. It was actually good food for a change (if you didn't mind the radioactivity and toxic waste traces). ▶ Killing for Cabbages ◀ This didn't go unnoticed by the non-farming communi- ties ... like the Boosters, gogangers, and anyone else not particularly interested in raising crops. Savage wars broke out over food-growing areas, with the body counts growing (only to be reprocessed into fer- tilizer when possible). Whole neighborhoods armed up and started patrolling their Upper Forties, ready to maim and kill anyone who had a hankering to steal a tomato. ▶ Meet the Meat ◀ Things got even more heated when some enterprising farmers began raising real chickens, dwarf pigs, and even goats (cows are still rare). Herds were shipped under Nomad protection with a heavy Solo element, creating a new form of \"cattle drive.\" Needless to say, there were attempts to rustle the range that ended up with many of the rustlers buried in the Night City equivalent of Boot Hill. ▶ The Market Price ◀ In the Time of the Red, things have died down a little. A tentative detente was reached, especially between the Growers and certain Neocorps. In exchange for some heavy security, the Growers traded fresh food, and both sides profited. This does not always hold up, however and there are still raids on individual city farms and rooftop gardens that come too close to the Oasis Markets operated by Continental Brands. H ow You Have Fun bRoADCAst No longer as pervasive a force in the Time of the Red, television has moved into the lowest level of mass entertainment. Far fewer channels crowd the airwaves, and most are various cable and subscriber channels limited to a single city or to small audiences of cities within a few hundred miles of each other. These cover everything including sports, news, music videos, old movies, foreign shows, religious program- ming, debate, erotic and adult programming, business news, and weather. In addition, there are still many single-band pirate radio stations scattered throughout the post-War world. netwoRk PRoGRAmminG In the Euro and Asian theaters, most programming is still state-controlled—the BBC in Great Britain and NGK TV in Japan—for example. In the United States, three privately owned entertainment networks domi- nate: recent arrival New Century Broadcasting (NCB), World Broadcasting Network (WBN), and Network News 54. These networks are the broadcast divisions of three massive entertainment conglomerates, each Cloning is still too expensive a process to make cloned meat a viable food for the masses.

With the collapse of the NET and the Sat Nets, however, network programming faces fierce competition from new entertainment forms, such as the Data Pool and PopMedia. sAtFeeDs In addition to network programming, there are still a few satellite feeds, featuring programming from around the world (many of the SatFeeds of the late 2020s were casualties of the War). There are also a large number of \"pirate\" TV stations, operating out of hidden stations and through cable and pirate Highrider satellite patch-ups. These are often a major source of news and information untainted by Corporate or government interference. In addition to the standard high definition flat screen TV of the pre-War era, experimental (and expensive— up to 10,000eb per set) 3-D holographic TV systems are available. PoPmeDiA By the mid-2020s, most media in America was controlled by one or more gigantic multimedia Megacorps, such as the ubiquitous Network 54 or its most aggressive rival, DNS. Even news was channeled through a Megacorporate filter, with World News Service (WNS) dominating the airwaves through its 22-channel, 24/7 news programming (heavily laden with subliminals and talking head commentary). The problem was that as the 21st century wore on, these mighty media megaliths became little more than house organs for their parent Corporations, or mouthpieces for the dominant political party of the time. With a corrupt FCC controlling access to the airwaves, there wasn't much chance that a dissenting voice could break through, so for most of the early Cyberpunk Age, people were resigned to a diet of insipid reality shows, mind-numbing entertainment vids, bad movies, and Corp-sponsored sports shows. Then came the 4th Corporate War and the DataKrash. The Mediacorps were the hardest hit by these events, since they depended on the NET's instantaneous communication and access to huge TV/ radio transmitters to broadcast their programming. But as established media outlets fell apart, new ways to disseminate information and programming arose to fill the gap. And the main format to make the cut was PopMedia. PopMedia is entertainment and news program- ming created by independent producers instead of huge Mediacorps. Combining audio, data, and visual images in a podcast-like format, PopMedia provides most of the Red Era's programming (as well as an ungodly amount of trash), most coming from five main sources: New Mediacorps, Rockers, Idols, Independents, and Medias. RoCkeRboys Named after the famed rebel rock star of the late '90s with the stage name of Rockerboy Manson, today's Rockerboys are performers or agitators who operate without the support of a New Mediacorp. They provide performance shows: concert footage, music tracks with visuals, personal observations, even braindance experiences. Idols are similar to Rockers, but their programming tends to be equivalent to an old-style \"reality\" show of the 2000s—it's all about the Idol. bRAinDAnCe An offshoot of the same neural interface technology that spawned the cyberware revolution, braindance is considered the purest form of entertainment around. The braindance unit consists of a memory chip play- back unit and a cable that can access an interface plug or convert to surface trodes. It plays chips which contain recorded experiences—not just visual and auditory info—but complete emotional and tactile info, as well. Braindance chips let you feel what the performer was feeling at the time (albeit heavily edited so as not to discomfort the buying public). As with most tech, braindance is a double-edged sword: it's been used to pacify prisoners almost as much as to entertain the masses. In the 2010s, it looked as if braindance tech- nology was to be the next great step in entertainment. However, psychological addiction and the expense of producing quality braindance chips has made this format less popular. A lot of PopMedia is consumed via the Garden, an \"all you can eat\" content platform run by Ziggurat. Setting up your own \"Garden Plot\" is free! 331 EVERYDAY LIFE boDy lotto The Night City \"Body Lottery\" is a regular nightly lottery where six winning numbers are chosen depending on how many corpses are found in areas of Night City. The numbers of the Body Lotto are taken from six random districts within the Night City Greater Metro Area. Numbers are derived from the locations that cadavers are found, not necessarily from where they were murdered. All numbers are accumulated by the Night City Police Department (or what remains of it) and verified by the investment firm of Merrill, Asukaga & Finch. People holding a winning ticket must contact the downtown offices of MA&F by 10a.m. the next morning. If no one claims the winning ticket, the next night's winnings go up by 1,000eb. W here You Get Stuff When you need to make big purchases, there are very few stores around in the Cyberpunk future. And if you're looking for an old-fashioned grocery store for a bag of soy chips (or to hold it up for a few bucks), forget it. venDits In the Time of the Red, most low-cost, day-to-day purchases are done via Vendits: self-contained vending machines that dispense everything from meals to clothing to weapons. All you have to do is swipe a cred-card over the scanner (Vendits do not trade in hard currency), press a few buttons or say a few words, and within moments your desired purchase drops out the slot. A Vendit can be placed almost anywhere; they are self-powered using a small thermal battery good for five years, and use an onboard datalink to call for repairs, refills, or even protection (although most don't need much protection, a Vendit typically counts as Thick Steel cover and has an installed Automated Turret with a Flamethrower (see pg. 214). ▶ whAt's in the neARest venDit?

They'd much rather have an Oasis on every corner. And they're willing to kill to get it! 333 BY RICHARD BAGNALL the newthe new street economystreet economy \"The quintessential 'punk needs quintessential warez. It's a necessity, chombatta.\" Gil Myxx 334 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY It's not post-holocaust, kids. It's economic scarcity. The cyberpunk writer and sage William Gibson once said, \"The future is already here—it's just not evenly-distributed.\" And that's a pretty good way to describe the situation of life on The Street in the Time of the Red. All the cool tech and advancements of the Golden 2020s are still around; but thanks to a nasty global war and a total disruption of supply chains, it's just really hard to get your hands on it. You can't even go down to the store because the store has been blasted by an anti-tank round, the company that owned the store has gone belly-up, and the shelves would be empty anyway because no one's been able to get their inventory stocked since the cargo ship car- rying it was sunk and the delivery truck was looted. B efore the War In the time before the War, almost 90% of all raw materials and completed goods moved, not by train or by truck as many assumed, but by the use of huge \"container\" ships plying the world's extended sea lanes. These ships allowed a kind of economics that had previously been unknown (save perhaps in the Late Bronze Age of the Mediterranean). Raw materials were gathered in one place where they were common, then shipped to another place that would turn those raw materials into finished components, which then might be shipped to another distant location where a factory would install the components into a finished product, which would then be shipped to receiving ports all over the world and sold in local stores near those ports. This system was further enhanced by the lightning-fast communications of the NET, which allowed producers and consumers to coordinate pro- duction so that there was little or no waste—a system known as \"just in time\" inventory. Before the War, there were literally thousands of these huge ships, all over the world, plying the sea lanes loaded with raw materials, partially finished materials, and completed, salable product. Each ship held thousands of identical metal transport containers called TEU's (twenty-foot equivalent unit) in the parlance of world shipping companies. Large container ships were able to transport up to 20,000 of these cargo containers, which would be loaded or offloaded in huge marshaling port yards by titanic giraffe-like cranes. A War of Supply Then came the Fourth Corporate War. This conflict was unique in that it occurred on both land and sea. Save for the Second Corporate War in which SovOil and Petrochem faced off in the South China Sea, pre- vious Corporate wars were primarily land-based. But with AHAG and CINO being nautical-based Corps, the war took on an added dimension finally focusing on denial of supply lines; this meant stopping soldiers and material from getting to where they were needed. Most of the early war supplies were carried by cargo subs controlled by individual companies. However, as the War became hotter, the Corps were forced to use the same transport methods as the rest of the developed world: the huge container ships. As part of their overall strategies, both sides in the War began to attack the supply lines of the other; starting with sabotage (and later full-on military attacks) of key ports. The conflict then escalated to attacks on individual ships suspected of carrying war materiel, which in turn lead to both sides deploying both well protected convoys and hunter/killer subma- rine packs. By the end of the war, literally all inter-ocean trans- shipping was halted. Ships were trapped in harbors or abandoned at sea, unable to get through the sub- marine blockades to safe harbors. By the end of the War, there were literally millions of TEUs of cargo, in raw and finished states, scattered all over the planet; some still sitting unloaded in blockaded ports, some drifting in container ships abandoned by their crews, still others left loaded onto trucks and trains that never left for their final destinations. And they’re still out there, waiting for someone to get their hands on them. the sPeCiAlists So, here's the scoop. In a post-holocaust world, there's nothing left. Looters have stripped away all the food and gear they can get their hands on, or it's otherwise BY DARIUSK 335 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY lost to the rest of civilization. But in the Time of the Red, there's literally millions of tons of perfectly usable stuff out there, if you can just figure out where it is and get a salvage team to it. But a salvage team is going to need a few elements: Netrunners: When the DataKrash started, almost every record of shipping manifests or bills of lading was obliterated by the virus. But a determined Netrunner might be able to track down the records in the architecture of their local Data Pool or in the storage archives of a local branch of a larger Megacorp. And a truly crazy Netrunner might even put their brain/life on the line to sneak into the remnants of the Old NET (assuming they can find a connection point) and seek out what scattered records could be assembled from the hash of false data and Black ICE. But if that risk netted you the location of a million brand new, unused Agents or a few dozen TEUs of raw lithium ore, you could become a billionaire overnight. If you could find someone to sell it to, that is. Fixers: Selling the contents of these abandoned TEUs is one of the things Fixers excel at. With their wide network of clients and contacts, Fixers are the people to go to when you need something or want to sell something. Fixers also are great at hiring people to get the stuff from one customer to another, hiring Solos to protect the stuff, Techs to assess or break into a TEU to get to the stuff, Lawmen to clear the stuff that needs to get past the local authorities (who'll want their cut), and various other entities (Execs who want to buy it, Rockerboys and Medtechs who want to use it, etc.). About the only people that Fixers don't have a grip on are the Nomads. R ise of the Nomads From their position as the refugees and riffraff of the Cyberpunk Golden Age, the fortunes of the Nomads have reversed, suddenly making them one of the most powerful groups around in the Time of the Red. They can be found in almost every environment and are 336 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY involved in the transshipping and protection of almost all of the goods that keep things running in the Time of the Red. You need something? Chances are a Nomad will be the one who gets it to you. nomADs in the wet Before the War, many Nomads were pirates, espe- cially in the waters of the South China Seas, the Straits of Magellan, and the Red Sea. These bands were often nationally based but made up of loose coalitions of families from the same area. In prime positions to hijack abandoned or lightly defended shipping, these Nomads went for it, thinking, \"Well, there's half the Lawmen in the South China Sea after us already, so we might as well get paid for it.\" Shipping companies also hired other Nomads to defend ships against pirates. These too were family groups. Nomads were the perfect groups for this: familiar with transportation tech and weapons, and with a strong family loyalty. The battles between the Pirates and the \"Ship Rats\" were often long and per- sonal feuds. As the 4th Corp War progressed, these Ship Rat Nomads came under attack by forces from rival Corps as well as Pirates. They were subsequently supplied with arms and gear by the shipping compa- nies, who, while not optimized for combat, were quite capable of paying for the hardware that their Ship Rats needed to defend their cargoes. Many Ship Rat crews had no choice but to take over the ships they protected and act as free agents, especially as many worldwide shipping companies had collapsed during the War. Gradually, the Ship Rats began to unite as family combines controlling more than one ship. Modeling themselves off the smuggling Families they interacted with on land, they created scattered shipping groups to replace the defunct world transhippers of the late 2020s. So, if you need to get to a ship, or get a ship into port, you're going to probably need a Ship Rat. nomADs on the DRy siDe Meanwhile, on land, Nomads often picked up where their Ship Rat cousins left off at the beach. They took up truck and delivery convoy work all over the U.S. and the Americas. These convoys were heavily defended and capable of moving vast amounts of cargo. They often went up against Road Gangers and other land pirates, as well as whatever local \"bosses\" tried to extort fees from them for crossing their territories. Already familiar with their enemies, the land-based Nomads were the best equipped group to tackle these raiders or rivals, eventually establishing well-defended convoys and monitored roadways (nicknamed \"Nomad High Roads\") that allowed cargo to spread out from the reclaimed marshaling yards at the major seaports. Once the ports were secured, still other Families established heavily armed, long-haul trucking lines that carried smaller loads throughout the old highway system. Finally, several Nomad packs took over the long-abandoned maglev and other train systems, which they armored up and used to transport huge amounts of TEU, spreading out several rail corri- dors that reach distant Chicago and St. Louis. sky PiRAtes The Nomads have also taken to the air, hijacking the few remaining large Aerozeps from the 2020s and pressing them into intermittent service as cargo and passenger ships. These also require Nomad protection in the form of armed small aircraft, aerodynes, and auto-gyros. There are still other Nomads who prey on these passenger ships, but no matter what their business all of these aerial Nomads are generally nicknamed \"Sky Pirates\" by those outside of their close-knit Family groups. The appellation of Sky Pirates is also applied to the Nomad Deltajocks who use the remaining military high orbital scramjets to deliver small, expensive and high value cargoes like medicine, tech parts, or even important passengers. These Deltajocks have a passing accommodation with the Highriders of the Low Earth Orbit Zone, but since they rarely stay in orbit for long, are considered to be a better type of \"groundpounder\" by the space-living group. W hy it isn't Post-holocaust When people outside of the un-United States think of the Time of the Red, they invariably think of a post-holocaust world—guys wearing hockey masks and assless chaps storming down desert roads in a convoy of spike-covered hot rods. But the reality of BY RICHARD BAGNALL 337 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY this period is far different. It's not like there isn't anything out there for people to live on. There's plenty of water, food, weapons, and CHOOH 2 for anyone who wants them. But they have to have the money to buy the goods, and someone (usually a Fixer) to locate them. Or to put it another way: although the huge Sammtung factories in Korea have fallen silent from a current lack of silicon microchips and lithium batteries, that just means no one in the Time of the Red is making new phones or Agents (it's going to take some time before the supply lines allow those factories to start up again). But in thousands of TEUs and storage warehouses (as well as abandoned stores) all over the planet, there are hundreds of millions of perfectly good phones and Agents stored away in bright shiny store packaging, complete with operators’ manuals. You just have to link up with someone who knows where they are, and is willing to provide a place for you to buy one. You need a Fixer—and a Night Market. N ight Markets Night Markets spring up all over the City, often without warning; whenever a good shipment comes in off a transport or something really useful is uncovered by the Nomads or Fixers. Similar to the old swap meets held in the 20th century, Night Markets are mobile shops mounted on trailers, vehicles, shipping containers, and whatever else has mobility and some spare volumetric to display stuff. Getting to a Night Market is as much about connections as it is about money. Some of the best markets are top secret affairs, which require connections or access codes just to find them. Night Markets can pop up for a few hours, then vanish forever, or regularly show up at specific sites where they can depend on enough security and space to set up shop over time. To find a Night Market, you can start asking around or find your local Fixer to see if they’ll hook you up. 338 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY niGht mARket GeneRAtoR what kind of night market iS it?

Unjamming your weapon doesn't require a Check. Cost varies based on the weapon’s base cost. Excellent Quality Weapons When attacking with an Excellent Quality Weapon you add a +1 to your Attack Check with it. Cost varies based on the weapon’s base cost.

A weapon is a Smartgun only when it has a Smartgun Link attached to it. Special Cyberware is required to take advantage of a Smartgun. A Smartgun Link must be connected to you with Interface Plugs or a Subdermal Grip in order to operate, both of which require you to have a Neural Link. A Subdermal Grip connects a Smartgun held in it automatically. You can plug in Interface Plugs as part of drawing a Smartgun into a free hand, as long as your Interface Plugs aren't already plugged into something else. Being disarmed of your Smartgun doesn't snap your cables, it just unplugs them from the Smartgun. Plugging them back in isn't an Action should you have the Smartgun in your hand, as their ports are designed for ease-of-use. Why go through all this trouble? Because when making Ranged Attacks with one, you add a +1 to your Check. Requires 2 Attachment Slots. ▶ sniPinG sCoPe Cost: 100eb (Premium) • Eligible: All Non-Exotic Ranged Weapons.

See Critical Injuries on pg. 187 . ▶ exPAnsive Ammunition Cost: 100eb (Premium) • Ammo Types Available: Arrows, Bullets, and Slugs. When using this ammunition, whenever you cause the Foreign Object Critical Injury, the victim rolls again on the Critical Injury table (see pg. 187) until they roll a Critical Injury that isn't Foreign Object. The victim then suffers that Critical Injury as well. This second injury deals no Bonus Damage. Armor-Piercing ammunition is the standard, basic level for Grenades and Rockets.. 346 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ FlAshbAnG Ammunition Cost: 100eb (Premium) • Ammo Types Available: Grenades only.

Targeting Scope Cyberware is required in order to make use of Smart Ammunition. When fired by a User without Targeting Scope Cyberware, Smart Ammunition won't fire even when the trigger is pulled, as a safety feature. When using this ammunition, whenever you miss a shot by 4 or less when using a weapon's single shot firing mode, your missed shot immediately has a second chance to hit your target. This second chance to hit is made by rolling again to hit the exact same shot DV on the range table which you missed, except that you add 10 to the d10 instead of anything you would typically add to the Check, with the only exception being LUCK. A target that can dodge bullets can choose to dodge this ranged attack as normal. 347 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ smoke Ammunition Cost: 50eb (Costly) • Ammo Types Available: Grenades only.

Fires paint balls, which are typically filled with paint, and thus deal no damage. If you filled the paint balls with Acid however, each Acid Paintball still deals no damage, but lowers the SP of the target's armor (worn in the location shot) by one with each successful hit. Great for trying to capture someone alive. Damage dealt by this weapon cannot cause a Critical Injury. Ammunition costs the same as for a normal Medium Pistol, even if filled with Acid. ▶ bAttleGlove Cost: 1,000eb (Very Expensive) A heavy gauntlet covering the hand and forearm. Contains three option slots for Cyberarm or Cyberlimb options. When worn, the options stored in the glove’s slots can be accessed. Putting on a Battleglove and taking one off is an Action.

Cannot be concealed. 348 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ Constitution ARms huRRiCAne AssAult weAPon Cost: 5,000eb (Luxury) An Exotic 2 ROF Shotgun. It cannot make Aimed Shots. Its drum holds 16 shots. Reloading this weapon requires using two Actions, and thus can only be done over the course of two turns. Firing this weapon requires BODY 11 or higher unless it is mounted. ▶ DARtGun Cost: 100eb (Premium) An Exotic Very Heavy Pistol that can only load Non-Basic Arrow Ammunition. Unlike other weapons that fire Arrows, a Dartgun has a clip of 8 Non-Basic Arrows and must be reloaded just like a typical Very Heavy Pistol. ▶ FlAmethRoweR Cost: 500eb (Expensive) An Exotic Shotgun fired with the Heavy Weapons Skill instead of the Shoulder Arms Skill. Mechanically, the flamethrower is a Shotgun that can only fire incendiary shotgun shells (ammunition cost is also the same as Incendiary Shotgun Shells), except that while your targets are ignited, until they spend an Action to put themselves out, they take 4 damage to their HP at the end of their turns. If they were already on fire, this fire effect replaces one that would deal less damage. Damage dealt by this weapon cannot cause a Critical Injury, and it cannot be used to make Aimed Shots. ▶ kenDAChi mono-thRee Cost: 5,000eb (Luxury) An Excellent Quality Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. With the correct biometric key, damage dealt by this weapon ignores the target's armor entirely if it is lower than SP11. Armor with a higher SP is still interacted with as normal. A high-tech katana with a nearly transparent crystal blade. Orbital crystal reinforces its redesigned microscopically serrated edge which vibrates four thousand times a minute when its handle is gripped by a user with a correct biometric key. In the hands of a user without the correct biometric key, the blade will not vibrate, leaving it only an Excellent Quality Two-Handed Exotic Very Heavy Melee Weapon. At no additional cost, any color of laser can be installed into the hilt to refract within the crystal blade, giving it a flaring neon glow. The most popular color is red. ▶ mAloRiAn ARms 3516 Cost: 10,000eb (Super Luxury) An Excellent Quality Exotic Very Heavy Pistol. It deals 5d6 damage with a single shot, and comes perma- nently installed with the Smartgun Link weapon attachment which must be connected (via Interface Plugs or a Subdermal Grip) in order for the weapon to operate. Extremely rare and sought after, this weapon is even more expensive today than it was in the past, when one even can be found for sale. ▶ miCRowAveR Cost: 500eb (Expensive) An Exotic Very Heavy Pistol. Instead of dealing damage, on a hit it forces the target to try to beat a DV15 Cybertech Check. If they fail, the GM chooses two pieces of their cyberware or carried electronics to become inoperable for a minute. Cyberlimbs that are rendered inoperable act as their meat counterparts do when Kendachi is a Japanese Corp specializing in glass and crystal production.

Instead of dealing damage, on a hit it forces the target to try to beat a DV15 Resist Torture/Drugs Check. If they fail, they suffer the Damaged Ear Critical Injury. Ammunition is costless as it runs off of easily rechargeable (1 hour) battery packs that need to be replaced after 8 shots. Extra battery packs are 50eb (Costly). ▶ stun bAton Cost: 100eb (Premium) A One-Handed Exotic Medium Melee Weapon.

Favored by Nomads and other 'punks who ride bikes. This also includes all those road-warrior wannabes wearing open-butt chaps and random sports equipment. Kevlar®: The favored protection for the past 90 years. To quote DuPont: Kevlar® is a heat-resistant, synthetic, lightweight fiber that delivers high tensile strength that brings improved protection and performance across a range of industries and applications. Like when people are trying to stab or shoot you. Can be made into clothes, vests, jackets, business suits, and even bikinis. Light Armorjack: A combination of Kevlar® and plastic meshes inserted into the weave of the fabric. Armorjack provides superior protection, especially against high-velocity bullets. Bodyweight Suit: Skinsuit with impact absorbing, sintered armorgel layered in key body areas. Surprisingly, they are also breathable and quite comfortable. Besides giving you a measure of protection, a Bodyweight Suit also has a place to store your Cyberdeck and supports your Interface Plugs so they stay out of the way while you're busy brain-burning that fool who just dared to pop a Hellhound on you. Many Netrunners wear clothing over their Bodyweight Suits, but plenty don't. It's a matter of personal style. Unlike other armor, a Bodyweight Suit isn't bought in two pieces, and must always be worn on both your body and head location. Each location has its own SP11. When repaired, both pieces are repaired at the same time. You can't wear more than one Bodyweight Suit. Wearing a Bodyweight Suit adds one Hardware only Option Slot to a Cyberdeck connected to it. Hardware installed in the Bodyweight Suit cannot be accessed if the armor isn't worn and can only take up 1 Option Slot. Medium Armorjack: Heavier Armorjack, with solid plastic plating, reinforced with thicker Kevlar® mesh. Typical Street wear, this combines decent protection with a decent ost. Heavy Armorjack: The thickest Armorjack, combining denser Kevlar® and a layered mix of plastic and mesh weaves. It stops all but the heaviest attacks, but costs a pretty eb. Flak: This is the 21st century version of the time-honored flak vest and pants with metal plates designed to provide protection from high explosive weaponry, artillery, grenades, shotguns, and anti-personnel mines. Modern flak will also stop many of the higher caliber rounds from automatic rifles. Metalgear®: You know how Evil Empire Storm Troopers just seem to stand there and take the hit? Metalgear® is the Dark Future equivalent of that type of armor: solid metal and plastic plates on a mesh body cover. Metalgear® will stop almost anything, but you're going to be easier to hit than a one-legged bantha in a potho race. 351 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY Bulletproof Shield: A transparent polycarbonate shield that can protect you in a firefight.

While not a true AI, it is more than capable of replacing any need for a secretary. When you sit back and allow your Agent to manage your life, everything is easier, including making sure you have time to do what you need to do (crimes, killing people, getting away with it, and so forth) instead of going to the store to get something you forgot. There are many reasons why almost everyone has one. Things your Agent can do: • Make phone calls in voice or video and record them, forward them, or send them to voicemail, which pretty much only Agents actually end up listening to nowadays. • Surf the Data Pool. • Scan the Data Pool to locate a known location and bring up directions. • Keep your schedule for you and act inde- pendently on events, like ordering a gift and having it delivered to the recipient. • Maintain a personality complete with name, voice, and virtual body. Some particularly lonely individuals reprogram their Agents to act as sur- rogate lovers or friends. • Suggest clothes for you to buy. • Record audio and video to the Agent's standard Memory Chip. • Link to your Cyberware to share data storage with them and the Agent's Memory Chip. • Link to most appliances in your living space. • Monitor your use of easily acquired resources (Cheap, Everyday, or Costly) and automatically reorder them when you get low at market price. • Recommend a future course of action based on your personal goals. AI may suggest unwise actions. In addition to all this, an Agent gives the user +2 to their Library Search Skill and +2 to their Wardrobe & Style Skill, but only if you wear the clothes your Agent suggests for you, which change every season. Multiple Agents don't multiply these bonuses. Airhypo: Easy to use drug distribution platform which uses a quick burst of compressed air to force a drug through the skin. Allows user to use an Action to administer a single dose of a desired drug to a willing target, or try to make a Melee Weapon Attack to administer a single dose to an unwilling target on a hit instead of dealing damage. Reloading the Airhypo with a dose of your desired drug isn't an Action. (See pg. 357 to score some street drugs). Anti-Smog Breathing Mask: Useful for filtering out toxins and smoke from the local environment. User is immune to the effects of toxic gasses, fumes, and all similar dangers that must be inhaled to affect the user. Audio Recorder: Device records up to 24 hours of audio before its output fills up a standard Memory Chip stored in the device. Auto Level Dampening Ear Protectors: Compact ear protection. When worn, user is immune to deafness or other effects caused by dangerously loud noises, like those produced by a flashbang. Binoculars: You look through them. They double or triple the size of what you are seeing. Braindance Viewer: Allows the user to experience braindance content. Braindances are digital record- ings of an experience which you view through the eyes of the actor. The experience includes all the subject's senses, and you feel every emotion felt, for better or worse. Bug Detector: Device beeps when user is within 2m/yds of a tap, bug, or other listening device. Carryall: Heavy ripstop nylon bags of varying sizes, from messenger to nearly man-sized duffel bags. Chemical Analyzer: Can test substances as an Action to find their precise chemical composition, identifying most substances instantly from a wide database of samples. Computer: Laptop or desktop computer, used mostly for comfortable word processing and surfing the Data Pool. 353 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY Cryopump: A Cryopump is a briefcase-sized tool containing a body bag hooked up to a powerful pump. Once willing/unconscious targets have been placed into the bag and hooked up to the pump as an Action, the pump forces a hyper-cooled chemical fluid into the bag, draining one of the Cryopump's charges per target put in stasis (one per person, if the Cryopump can accept multiple people). While in stasis, targets are unconscious and no longer roll any Death Saves for up to a week, as long as they remain inside the bag and the bag has at least 1 HP. A Character in a cryopump bag is considered to be behind a piece of cover that has 15 HP. The bag's transparent top and gloves molded into the lining allow the target to undergo surgery and be stabilized while in stasis, which is much less danger- ous to the patient. A standard Cryopump has only 1 charge and can only hold a single roughly human- sized target. Refueling a Cryopump costs 50eb (Costly) per charge. A Character who is not a Medtech cannot operate a Cryopump. Cryotank: A Cryotank is a human-sized container which can hold a fully grown adult. Assuming the Medtech succeeds at a DV13 Medical Tech Check, the Cryotank keeps 1 person in stasis as long as desired. While in the Cryotank, they are consid- ered to be unconscious, but they heal at double the normal rate as long as they remain inside the tank and the tank has at least 1 HP. A Character in a Cryotank is considered to be behind a piece of cover that has 30 HP. A Character who is not a Medtech cannot operate a Cryotank.

A safe and comfortable place is preferable. At the beginning of every month, you'll have to settle your Housing and Lifestyle Costs. If you must pick one or the other, it's better to be evicted than to starve to death. Going without at least 6 hours of sleep a day will give you a -2 to everything you attempt for each day since you've last slept a full 6 hours. Sleeping in an uncomfortable situation will leave you fatigued the next day, which will penalize you an additional -2 to everything you attempt while fatigued. This won't kill you, but it doesn't feel good, either. What does sleeping uncomfortable mean? 1. Being crammed: sleeping in housing with a number of persons greater than 1 + the number of bedrooms. Persons unconscious in Cryo-stasis and corpses do not count toward this limit. A Cube Hotel is the only exception. Sleeping with more than one person in a cube is always sleeping uncomfortable and will leave you fatigued the next day. 2. Sleeping on the street. Unless you make a successful DV15 Endurance Check, sleeping on the street will leave you fatigued. Sleeping on the street is also asking for trouble. 3. Sleeping in the wilderness. Unless you make a successful DV15 Wilderness Survival Check, sleeping in the wilderness will leave you fatigued. Unlike sleeping on the street, other persons can roll this Wilderness Survival Check for you. Nomad friends are nice to have. ▶ The Big Money: Real Estate ◀ Likely, where you sleep will be your largest monthly expense. You may start out in a cargo container located outside of the city, but if you start saving up, you'll be able to move to a more secure arrangement in no time. Or you could become an Exec, never have to pay rent, and live in comfortable security from the begin- ning ... just by selling your soul into Corporate slavery! Just remember, the game is rigged. L ifestyle and housing Your Lifestyle determines how you live, what you eat, and how you have fun. Whenever you live beyond the Lifestyle you paid for at the beginning of the month, the GM will charge you separately for your expenditures. If you don't pay for your lifestyle at the start of a month, you have one week to do so before you roll a Death Save at the start of each day you don't. A kibble lifestyle is only 100eb a month. You shouldn't starve ... but the only difference between some brands of Kibble and dog food is cheeseburger flavoring. Lifestyle What it Entails Monthly Cost Kibble You eat horrible food that you might not buy for a dog you liked. Once a month, you can see a movie or braindance. 100eb Generic Prepak You eat food which tastes much better than kibble, by comparison. Each weekend, you can afford to go out to a good bar and party or have a sit-down meal at a good restaurant. 300eb Good Prepak Your food is the same quality as most restaurants, and while still artificial it tastes almost exactly the same as real food. You frequent excellent bars and restaurants when you go out. Once a month, you can see a Live Concert or Sporting Event. 600eb Fresh Food You eat real food. Once per month if you are tired and too far from home, you can get a nearby hotel room and not worry about your budget. You frequent an executive bar.

Sleeping on the street is also asking for trouble. You have no security, heating, or electricity to speak of, and you can't realistically have more things than you could carry at any given time. You wouldn't be doing this if you owned a car. ▶ livinG on the stReet in A vehiCle Living on the street is asking for trouble. Your vehicle requires fully enclosed glass to do this. You will have limited security unless your vehicle has a Security upgrade and Bulletproof windows. You have enough room to store your stuff, and with a bed, inflatable or otherwise, you can sleep comfortably. Otherwise, unless you make a successful DV15 Endurance Check, sleeping in your car will leave you fatigued the next day (You have -2 to everything you attempt while fatigued). You've got Electricity, but no Water unless your Vehicle is designed to be lived in. You can't sleep in your car in Corporate, Executive, or Moderate Zones without being forced to leave at gunpoint by security forces. Either you park in the Combat Zone to sleep, or you stick to the city's Outskirts. ▶ Cube hotel Cube Hotels are located in Zones with Corporate, Moderate, and Combat Threat Ratings. This is by far the cheapest way to live in the city. You live in a single windowless room with a nice strong lock where you can touch both walls if you spread your arms. Flatpack furniture folds out of the walls, converting your cell from a chair with a desk to a bed with a small television. Living here, you can't realistically have more things than you could carry at any given time, plus the contents of a backpack you can safely store behind the bed when it folds into the wall. Sleeping with more than one person in a cube is always sleeping uncomfortable and will leave you fatigued the next day (You have -2 to everything you attempt while fatigued). Down the hall, past all of your equally compacted neighbors, there is a common room that has running water and a bathroom with a shower. Even going near this common room is a bad idea unless you are properly gang affiliated. Most people keep three water bottles in their rooms just to avoid entering the common room. There's a single window on the opposite side of the cell block where these bottles are emptied. If you own a vehicle and you live here, you likely park it on the street. 379 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ CARGo ContAineR Cargo Containers are located in the Suburbs, Reclaimed Perimeter, and the Combat Zone. You'll have plenty of places to store your things, a bed to sleep comfortably, a desk, electricity, a refrigerator, microwave, and sink, protected by the security of a strong lock. In the Combat Zone, you'll be in danger the second you step outside, but if you live in the Outskirts, you'll be much safer. Restrooms, Showers, and Laundry are located in facilities you'll share with the residents of other Cargo Containers stacked nearby your container. If you own a vehicle and you live here, you likely park it on the street. If you live in the Combat Zone, it will probably get broken into on occasion. If you chose the Outskirts, it will probably be fine. ▶ stuDio APARtment Studio Apartments are located in Zones with a Corporate, Moderate, or the Combat Threat Rating. The typical Studio is not spacious by any stretch of the imagination but is the first housing option that truly feels like your own private space. You'll have a bed to sleep comfortably, and a small kitchen, with range, oven, microwave, and a large refrigerator. You'll have your own private bathroom, with a shower where you can't be attacked. You'll have a tiny living room to decorate as you see fit. Laundry facilities are still shared with your neighbors, however. The Studio Apartment comes with a single space of protected parking, meaning your vehicle will be safe. ▶ two-beDRoom APARtment Two-Bedroom Apartments are located in Zones with a Corporate, Moderate, or the Combat Threat Rating. This comfortable apartment has enough space for two people to live together without ripping each other's cybereyes out. Two Bedrooms, a full-size kitchen, one bathroom you'll probably squabble over, a living room with enough space for a comfortable couch, and laundry in the unit make this apartment seem like luxury when compared to a cargo container or a disgusting cube. The apartment comes with two spaces of protected parking, meaning your vehicles will be safe. ▶ CoRPoRAte ConAPt Corporate Conapts are located in the Zones with a Corporate Threat Rating, in buildings controlled by individual Corporations. You can't rent or buy a Corporate Conapt, but you might be able to live in one if you know an Exec. The Conapts are luxury accommodations; two bedrooms, two bathrooms, a full-size kitchen, dining room, and large living room that opens up into a small balcony that usually smells like smoke. Laundry is in the unit. Surveillance by the Corp that controls the building should be expected in every room except the bathrooms. Messing with Corporate employee surveillance equipment will lead to a 50eb (Costly) fine if discovered, but the sound of the laundry machine is well known to interfere with their ability to record audio. Plenty of Execs treat a monthly 50eb fine as a cheap price to pay for privacy, and nobody has ever really gotten fired for it. Every Corporate Conapt comes with two spaces of protected parking, meaning your vehicles will be safe. ▶ uPsCAle ConAPt Upscale Conapts are located in the Zones with a Corporate or Moderate Threat Rating. These are spacious two floor apartments with two bedrooms and bathrooms, in addition to a luxurious master bedroom and master bathroom on the second floor. Other amenities include a full kitchen, dining room, two living rooms, and a balcony with a nice view of the city. An Upscale Conapt comes with three spaces of protected parking, one of which can be located on the roof, perfect for an Air Vehicle. Your vehicles will be safe. The trend of using Cargo Containers as housing started with Nomads who used them to help shelter the refugees fleeing the 4th Corporate War. 380 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ luxuRy Penthouse Luxury Penthouses are located on the tops of buildings in Zones with a Corporate Threat Rating. The height of luxury in city living. Two floor layout includes three bedrooms and two bathrooms on the first floor with a master bedroom and bathroom on the second floor. Other amenities include two living rooms, an entertainment room, facilities room, full kitchen, and palatial dining room. The Luxury Penthouse also spills out onto a private roof, on which is located an infinity pool, sitting area, and barbecue for entertaining, in addition to a private helipad. In addition to the helipad, the penthouse comes with four spaces of protected parking, accessible via private elevator. Your vehicles will be safe. Complementary maid service is also included, courtesy of the building management. ▶ CoRPoRAte beAveRville house A Beaverville House is located in the Executive Zone, in an area known affectionately by many as Beaverville. You can't rent one, because renters drive down property values and introduce strangers into the community. The streets are patrolled by Lazarus Corp private security. Owning a home in Beaverville gives you four security badges that grant access to the bullet train connecting it to the Corporate Zone, as well as the freedom to not be harassed by security while jogging in Beaverville. Aside from the security presence, Beaverville is a charming community full of freshly mown lawns, white picket fences, and culs-de-sac. It's the perfect place for the Corporate elite to raise a family. These smaller homes in Beaverville are quaint and neighborly. Two floors, three bedrooms, two bathrooms, with a master bedroom and bathroom on the second floor. The bottom floor contains a sunken living room that connects sidelong into a full-size kitchen, which exits onto a charming patio, like the set of a sitcom. The backyard and lawn are synthetic, constructed of Realtree™ and Realgrass™, the latest from Biotechnica. Complementary maid service is also included. Your Beaverville security badges will also grant you access to the country club located in the more well-appointed district of Beaverville. That is, assuming you are invited by an existing member. The country club is replete with facilities, including a world class restaurant, bar, world class gym, paddleball and tennis courts, golf, croquet, heated indoor pool, dedicated lap pool, hot tubs, sauna, and steam room. The country club also contains a business lounge that's considered neutral ground in the Corporate world, a place where even rival companies can meet and discuss terms. These are the closed doors behind which business really gets done. ▶ CoRPoRAte beAveRville mCmAnsion In addition to the benefits of living in Beaverville in the Executive Zone, which are listed above in the description of a mere Beaverville House, living in a Beaverville McMansion means living there in a suburban castle of splendorous proportions. You'll have three floors, four bedrooms, five bathrooms, a master bedroom and bathroom, a four-car garage and a helipad. Three living rooms with vaulted ceilings, a bar in the basement, a personal gym, and a poolside patio. Your lawn is real grass. Your backyard is meticulously landscaped every season of the year by staff paid by the Homeowner's Association. Beaverville can’t have their best looking less. Complementary maid service is also included. Living in a Beaverville mansion isn't just about living there, it’s also a way to declare that you've arrived in the community. You have either paid enough to earn this recognition, or instead demand it by having very powerful friends, and the greater community recognizes both as being equally impressive. You can expect preferential treatment in the Country Club, which you live within walking distance to, whether it be on the golf course, its world class restaurant, or behind the natural leather doors of the business lounge. Your McMansion comes with six Beaverville security badges, but if you live like this, you'll hardly ever need to flash them. 381 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY M aking a Living in a Cyberpunk World It’s not easy. Survival is a good starting goal, but you don’t want to just live. You want to thrive and buy ammunition. The game is rigged against almost everybody, and the only way to win is to get rich, quickly. Everything has a price, and when you are just starting out you are going to have to snatch every last eurobuck you can get your hands on just to pay up when the rent is due to stay off the street. woRkinG FoR A euRobuCk (wAys to mAke money) An Edgerunner in the Time of the Red makes most of their scratch one of three ways: • Doing jobs • Hustling • Buying and selling ▶ Doing Jobs ◀ You, like most, work for a living. Except, unlike most other people, your job can get you killed in messy ways. Often, the pay you can expect to receive for a job, after you fence everything and divide up the spoils, is roughly equal to the amount of mortal danger you signed up for. This is of course, assuming you don’t take bad jobs that are way too dangerous for what they pay. Okay, let’s stop pretending. You make this mistake all the time. Treat this as a guideline for the best-case scenario. Job Type Explanation & Example Pay for Job (Per Person) Easy Job Armed resistance is not expected. But you never know. Protect this VIP from a possible threat to their life. 500eb Typical Job Armed resistance is expected, but you can be prepared for it. Every four hours the guards change their patrols. I need that diamond. 1,000eb Dangerous Job Armed resistance is overwhelming. Without heavy preparation, you die. Sneak into the military facility and blow up the armory, then escape. 2,000eb ▶ The Hustle ◀ Whenever you have a full seven days free (this will often happen because the rest of your friends are healing from gunshot wounds), you can work to earn a little eb. The amount you are paid is dependent on your Role, your Role Ability Rank, and the outcome of rolling 1d6. You’ll notice that your pay seems pretty low. Don’t worry. As an Edgerunner, this isn’t your primary stream of income. The real way to get paid is to get a crew together to do a Job. whaT is a eurobucK, anyway? At the basic level, a eurobuck is the currency currently in use among the nations who are part of the European Union. It's blue, comes in various denomi- nations and has embossed national symbols of all the member nations brightly shining on each bill. It's also formally called a Eurodollar, but nobody in Night City ever calls it that. But since the European Union is one of the most stable economies on the planet in the Time of the Red, the eurobuck (or eb for short) become the \"gold standard\" to which all other currencies are currently pegged (much as the American Dollar was before the Collapse). Even if you're not physically exchanging eurobucks for most transactions chances are your purchases or sales, whether handled via credit chips, downloads, or digital accounts, are measured in Eurodollars as they are the standard of exchange almost everyone can agree on. 382 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ RoCkeRboy hustle Roll What you did to make bank that week Role Ability Rank 1 to 4 Role Ability Rank 5 to 7 Role Ability Rank 8 to 10 1 Played a small local gig. 200eb 300eb 600eb 2 No gigs or jobs to be had this week. 0eb 100eb 300eb 3 Played a big gig for a rich Corporate or Local Personality. 300eb 500eb 800eb 4 Got some royalties in for your most recent Data Pool download. 300eb 500eb 800eb 5 Opening act for a Big-Name group. 300eb 500eb 800eb 6 Personal appearance netted you a large fee. 200eb 300eb 600eb ▶ solo hustle Roll What you did to make bank that week Role Ability Rank 1 to 4 Role Ability Rank 5 to 7 Role Ability Rank 8 to 10 1 Bodyguard work, low-end client. 100eb 200eb 500eb 2 Bodyguard work, high-end client. 200eb 300eb 600eb 3 Difficult hit or extraction. 200eb 300eb 600eb 4 Hired out as muscle to a Fixer, Corp, or Gang. 100eb 200eb 500eb 5 Attracted undue attention, had to lay low. 0eb 100eb 300eb 6 Basic enforcer or hitman work for a local Corp. 100eb 200eb 500eb ▶ netRunneR hustle Roll What you did to make bank that week Role Ability Rank 1 to 4 Role Ability Rank 5 to 7 Role Ability Rank 8 to 10 1 Cracked a small system and sold the data. 100eb 200eb 500eb 2 Cracked a major Corporate system and sold the data. 200eb 300eb 600eb 3 You got sidetracked and didn’t hack anything this week. 0eb 100eb 300eb 4 Found a valuable data cache in an abandoned system and sold it. 200eb 300eb 600eb 5 Brought down a major system with ransomware and got paid off to uninstall it. 200eb 300eb 600eb 6 Sabotaged or otherwise disabled a major system for a faceless client. 200eb 300eb 600eb 383 THE NEW STREET ECONOMY ▶ teCh hustle Roll What you did to make bank that week Role Ability Rank 1 to 4 Role Ability Rank 5 to 7 Role Ability Rank 8 to 10 1 No jobs this week. 0eb 100eb 300eb 2 Rebuilt some tech you scavenged in the Combat Zone. 100eb 200eb 500eb 3 Helped a client break into some place or installed security systems for a client. 200eb 300eb 600eb 4 Did some modifications or repairs to some cybertech. 100eb 200eb 500eb 5 Did some modifications or repairs to some weapons. 100eb 200eb 500eb 6 Sabotaged or otherwise disabled something for a client. 100eb 200eb 500eb ▶ meDteCh hustle Roll What you did to make bank that week Role Ability Rank 1 to 4 Role Ability Rank 5 to 7 Role Ability Rank 8 to 10 1 Patched up someone after a firefight. 100eb 200eb 500eb 2 Sold cyberware from a \"failed\" medical case. 200eb 300eb 600eb 3 Helped Trauma Team on some backup work when they were overloaded. 100eb 200eb 500eb 4 Did some minor \"free clinic\" work for locals.

First off, you’re always selling it to someone, or buying it from someone, and you two aren’t the only people in the city. All transactions happen in the context of an economy, which determines the current Market Price for an item. The economy of the Time of the Red is one of scarcity where more often than not supply is low, and demand is high. Without the help of an experienced Fixer or one of their Night Markets, only items up to Premium can be purchased. Everything you buy in Cyberpunk RED falls into one of eight Price Categories, which determines their Market Price. If you aren’t a Fixer, forget about getting it cheaper. If it’s Expensive and you don’t know a Fixer, forget about getting it at all. eveRythinG is eveRythinG is worthworth whAt its whAt its PuRChAseR will PuRChAseR will paypay FoR it, ChoombA.

Cyberpunk is a challenge for even an experienced Gamemaster, in that you must create the right atmosphere of grunginess, sleek technology, and pervasive paranoia throughout your entire game. Running cyberpunkRunning cyberpunk so... how do i run this game, anyway?so... how do i run this game, anyway? 388 RUNNING CYBERPUNK The classic Cyberpunk environment is almost always exclusively urban. Its landscape is a maze of towering skyscrapers, burned out ruins, dingy tenements, and dangerous alleyways. In short, any major city in the world at about 2:30 in the morning when the lowlifes come out in force. T he Urban Environment The urban environment is critical to your Cyberpunk world. Whether you use our Night City or create your own, remember that your setting has to have all the right elements. There should be garbage-strewn alleyways. There should be bodies lying in the gutters. There should be wild-eyed lunatics, staggering through pre-dawn streets, muttering darkly and clutching sharp knives. Taxis won’t stop in the Combat Zones. There are firefights at the street corner as the local gangs slug it out. Players should find their apartments regularly broken into, their cars vandalized, their property stolen. Crossing town should be like crossing a battlefield, filled with looters, riots, crazies, and muggers. But it doesn’t always rain. At least, not since the Time of the Red messed up the upper atmosphere (this is what you get when you throw Lunar rocks into the Earth). Expect wild shifts in weather patterns as things are still settling down. The ozone layer decayed, the greenhouse effect took over, the sky is full of hydrocarbons and the ocean full of sludge. Nice place. But what about those classic, rain-wet, neon streets we see in all good Cyberpunk movies? Yeah, it does rain a lot. Most days should be grim, gloomy, and overcast. When the sun does come out, it should be the overly bright gold of a smoggy Los Angeles day, with brilliant (heavily polluted) sunrises and sunsets. And the stars never come out, because of the smog. There are no singing birds in a Cyberpunk world (the last unmodified bird died some- time around 2008), at least not in the city—but they’re starting to creep back into the outer areas as some of Biotechnica’s more ... experimental projects come to fruition (hint: some of those things are not birds—at least as we know them). There are laughing children these days, but they may be laughing over things you and I would be kind of appalled at. Growing up in a nuclear bomb zone gives you an odd perspective on life. Kids don’t get much raising on The Street, and what raising they do get usually involves drugs, guns, and unhealthy extracurricular activities. There are no day-cares other than kid gangs. T rust No One keep your ... er … minami 10 handy Paranoia is important in a Cyberpunk run. Players shouldn’t be able to tell who are the good guys and who are the bad just by looking at them. Choices between sides should be ambiguous—there should be no clear-cut sense of good and evil, much like real life. Sworn enemies may be thrown together without notice or preparation. Heroes may have to do something illegal or distasteful to accomplish something good; villains may have to do a little good once in a while. It’s the breaks. cybPerunK PLayers read This! This chapter's mostly about running Cyberpunk RED as the Gamemaster. If that doesn't interest you, we recommend you skip to the one part that pertains specifically to Players, the rules for \"leveling up\" your Characters via earning and spending Improvement Points. You can find those rules on page 408. You can also turn to page 435, where you'll find Black Dog, a fictional story that shows what the world's like in the Time of the Red. If you're not planning on running Cyberpunk RED, it is a good idea to avoid pages 425 thru 433, as those contain adven- tures your GM might be using for your game. You do want to be sur- prised, don't you? 389 RUNNING CYBERPUNK C ontrast Your world should have staggering contrasts. In the glittering citadels of the rich there should be fine food, expensive vices, and beautiful scenery. On The Street, things should be cold, hungry, and desperate. There’s no middle ground between the haves and have-nots. It’s all or nothing. K now the World First trick to running Cyberpunk: Immerse yourself in the genre. We’ve given you a start with the stories scat- tered throughout this book: Never Fade Away (on pg. 5) sets the tone of a Cyberpunk world, Fall of the Towers (on Pg. 121) shows you how a good covert (and not so covert) op should feel, and Black Dog (on pg. 435) should give you the differences in style between a purely urban setting and the new \"death- road highway\" settings the Time of the Red has brought to the game table. All of these should give you the style of speech, the feel, and the hard-edged realities of a Cyberpunk world. But you should also hit the local video-store, the library, and the record shops (or, you know, the Internet) for source material. We’ve included a bib- liography of places to start in the sidebar. P lay for Keeps Second trick to running Cyberpunk: Play hard and fast. You should not be afraid to kill off Player Characters. You should constantly be getting them into fights, traps, betrayals, and other soap operas. There should be no one they can trust entirely, no place that’s absolutely safe. Never let ’em rest. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t play fair. But you should always play for keeps. If they cache weapons somewhere, steal them. If they stop for a rest, mug them. If they can’t handle the pressure, they shouldn’t be playing Cyberpunk. Send them back to that nice roleplaying game with the happy elves and the singing birds. We’ve given you some great encounter tables which we suggest you use every time the action drags (see pg. 417). S et the Mood The third trick to running Cyberpunk: Atmosphere. Get out your heaviest rock tapes and play them during your run. Encourage your Players to wear leather and mirrorshades. Adopt the slang and invent your own. Replace all the lights in your room with dim blue bulbs. This is the Dark Future here; and it can’t be accurately portrayed in a brightly lit room with milk and cookies on the table. We’ve listed a few tricks in the sidebars of this chapter. T eamwork the more the bloodier Four th and last tr ick to r unning Cyberpunk: Teams. You’ll notice that Cyberpunk groups are not social. The Players will have no reason to trust anyone, and the conventional reasons (stop evil, kill bads) for a Crew won’t work. A bar isn’t a place to meet new Edgerunners—it’s a place to scope out potential victims. Crews are more likely to kill each other in a firefight than divide the spoils fairly. the teAm is the hook For this reason, you’ll need a more solid \"hook\" on which to hang a Cyberpunk adventure. Our hook is the team. A team is a group of people who are already cyberPunK bibLioGraPhy Synners by Pat Cadigan Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Phillip K.

They don’t have to like each other, but they have to work together. Besides giving the Party a springboard from which to work, the team also makes the adventure easier to run. Players can be given assignments from a \"higher power,\" or the entire group can be faced with a problem which requires cooperation to solve. The group stays together, or it dies. Simple. M eet the Teams We’ve given you several Teams which might naturally evolve in the Cyberpunk world. Each proposes a good mix of Character Roles and offers many ways in which all the Players can become equally involved. neoCoRPoRAte teAms Corporate teams are groups that are oriented around a specific Corporation, working together to accom- plish the company’s goals. The main base of opera- tions is the Corporation’s offices or security areas. A good Corporate team might consist of one or more Execs (an executive and an assistant), a Netrunner (who runs the team’s intrusion and computer systems), a Fixer (who deals with the team’s Street contacts), a Tech (either medical or mechanical), and two to three Solos (who handle the combat). bAnDs Bands are any group of Rockerboys who have gotten together to play music. The band travels from place to place, getting into trouble at each new gig, holding concerts and raising hell. Their main base of operations can be a practice hall, a club, or a road bus. There may be any number of Rockerboys in the band itself (although three to four is consid- ered best). In addition, there will be at least one Fixer (who acts as manager), a possible Tech (to handle equipment needs), and several Solos (who are both bodyguards and roadies). Various other slots such as groupies and tour personnel can be Nomads, Execs (playing record execs), and Medias (as rock-reporters or reviewers).BY HUNTANG 391 RUNNING CYBERPUNK Cults AnD boosteRGAnGs Not just for NPCs these days, any group of Players can aspire to be in a boostergang or other cult. The Players may have ended up on The Street through job loss, personal tragedy, or just from a desire to find a socially acceptable outlet to kill, loot, and pillage. ReClAimeRs Reclaimers are a new thing in the Time of the Red. Pioneering sorts with a desire to carve homes out of the abandoned cities of Old America, Reclaimers come from all walks of life and have all kinds of reasons why they have banded together to rebuild their homestead. A Nomad leading the group on its journey to the new location is an excellent idea, and Solos and Fixers will be needed to protect the supplies and group while they work. Netrunners may want to exploit any abandoned NET nodes or Corporate/military systems lying in wait. tRAumA teAms Trauma Teams are groups of licensed paramedics who patrol the city looking for accident victims. They operate from an AV-4 Urban Assault Vehicle, redesigned into an ambulance configuration and armed with a belly-mounted minigun. A typical Trauma Team would include a driver (Exec, Fixer or Solo, although Nomad is best), one or more Medtechs, and two or more Solos acting as \"security.\" The team may also have a Dispatcher (Exec or Fixer) in charge of sending them on their missions. A Media might also tag along with the team, writing stories about their adventures. meRCenARies Mercs are often hired throughout the Cyberpunk world when more powerful people don’t want to get their hands dirty. A typical merc group could include at least one Fixer (to handle contracts), one Netrunner (to handle security systems, computer assault, etc.), one Tech (for weapons), one Medtech (for wounded), and any combination of Solos or Nomads (as grunt soldiers). It wouldn’t be out of line to have a Media there, writing as a war correspondent. A merc group could operate out of a club, a bar, or a well-hidden paramilitary base camp. GAnGs Gangs and countergangs are usually the enemy in Cyberpunk. But why not turn the tables? Gangs can also be created for positive purposes: neighborhood defense, to stop other more violent gangs, or to resist a major invasion by government or the Corps. In this context, you could look at Robin Hood or the WWII Resistance as gangs. A typical gang would have lots of Solos, Nomads, and Fixers. There might be a Medtech or Tech around, and possibly even an Exec if the gang is one of those controlled by a covert organization. A Media could be covering the gang from The Street angle. Gangs operate out of clubs, bars, and deserted buildings. seTTinG The mood In a lot of ways, setting up a good Cyberpunk game is like going on a date. You pick a time and a place to go to (yours?), you provide a sophisticated meal (okay, so it's soy chips and the brew of your choice), and your goal is to show your guests a good time. But what's missing? The answer is ambiance. You wouldn't start a date in a room lit by bright flo- rescent lights, would you? Naw, you're going to want to set the mood. Swap out the bright room lamps for dimmer ones, or even a few colored bulbs (violet and blues are best). Scatter the occasional flashing strobe in the mix (make sure it isn’t a health risk first, though) and you're golden. And play some romantic music; in Cyberpunk, this means jarring atonal rock, solid hip hop, heavy metal, or various types of techno and digital music (Kavinsky or Vangelis are among our faves). Last but not least, instead of spra y ing per f ume around the room, open a bag of week-old garbage. That'll get them in the proper mood! 392 RUNNING CYBERPUNK nomAD PACks Nomad packs are natural teams; they’re already together in one group and everyone knows each other. A good Nomad pack could include a few Fixers (to handle in-town negotiations), a Netrunner (who handles the pack’s intelligence work), a mixture of Techs and Medtechs, and any number of Nomads and Solos. The pack operates from the caravan, an assemblage of RVs, trailers, buses, and cars moving across the blasted landscape of freeway America. The pack members could travel with the main caravan, or as scouts traveling ahead in their own vehicles. lAwmen The Lawman team could operate out of a seedy, heavily fortified police station. They might include a few Fixers on the Vice Squad, a Netrunner on counter intelligence, a Captain (Exec) who handles connections with the City government, and a large number of grunt cops. Don’t forget a few maddened Solos on the Psycho Squad. A Media might also choose to follow the cop team, looking for hot stories on the crime beat. But a Lawman team might also be a band of hard driving/riding marshals who scour the open road seeking out the gogangs and roadwarrior wannabes who infest the highway or a private investigation firm. meDiA teAms Media teams go anywhere, and do anything to get the story. A Media team can operate out of a TV or radio station, a newspaper office, or even a major network news bureau. A good Media team might include two or three Medias (as hard-hitting reporters), a Netrunner (running communications, information gathering, and computer snooping), a Tech for the equipment, and a couple Solos or Nomads to provide muscle and protection. A good newsroom also has at least one harried Exec who has to cover the team with the bosses upstairs. Don’t Give uP youR DAy Job Any one of these Teams can fit a Character role that isn’t described. A low-level Rockerboy could moonlight as a Trauma Teamer while waiting for that big score. A Netrunner might do a little time with a Corporate team, while sneaking into the Company mainframe at night. A Nomad might do almost anything to earn money while his pack is in town. In these cases, the main Character role should be treated as an interest, which may become more important to the team as time passes. A Cyberpunk Masterclass or how maximum mike buildS hiS miSSionS at rtg. it’s AlwAys stReet level A good Cyberpunk game isn’t about saving the world: it’s about saving yourself. This basic principle shows up throughout the genre. The heroes are not super heroic; at best they’re low to medium successful professionals (Humphrey Bogart’s portrayals PLay your enemies smarTer Don't think of your bad guys as mere obstacles for your players. Sit down a moment and put yourself in their heads. What do they fear? What are their desires? What do they value? For starters, they fear getting killed. That means they will do just as much as any Character to prevent this from happening. If Characters wear armor, the bad guys will wear armor. If the Characters set traps, the bad guys will set traps. If your NPCs are smart, they'll make the PCs work to kill them. They’ll boob- ytrap doors instead of just locking them. They’ll hide in ambush with long-range weapons. They’ll crash AVs through the sides of the Crew’s hideout. They’ll send out decoys bioscupted to look like them. They’ll find out who the players value most and use them as hostages. In short, they will never, ever just walk into a room without armor, carrying a big gun, and expect to survive. Make your NPCs real, three-dimensional people. A few smart baddies will go a lot farther than a million dumb ones.BY EDDIE MENDOZA 393 RUNNING CYBERPUNK of Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade on the Silver Screen are good examples) who are often prone to having shady pasts and failures to live down. A good GM should assume the Players have basic skills but are not totally badass. it’s AlwAys A CAPeR A \"Caper\" is a time-honored part of the crime genre, although sometimes (like in the venerable Mission Impossible franchise) it can be in the spy genre instead. The Caper involves getting a team of professionals with rather dubious skills together to steal, kidnap, sabotage, or even assassinate a particular person, place, or thing. Sometimes called \"The Heist,\" a Caper is the best way to get a play group together, keep them focused, and make sure they all get a great payoff at the end. Capers almost always involve a Caper Crew: a team assembled to pull off the Job. Often a Caper Crew will get a rep and be hired over and over by a succession of clients, with the terms worked out by their Fixer. A good Caper should use as many Character Roles as possible in their Caper Crew. Good Role choices include: The Mastermind: This is the Player organizing the Job. Most often a Fixer as they have the cash to bankroll under the table jobs, but an Exec can fill this slot too. Either way, a Caper Crew often has someone paying to get the job done. The Mastermind may not be going along on the Job, but they have a stake and they’re not going to be happy if it all goes sideways. The Runner: This is the Player who provides your NET cover, opening remote doors, spying out cyberspace traps, taking control of security systems, and always scanning ahead of the Caper Crew for problems. The Tech: This is the Player who brings the Gear. It can be specialized stuff, or off the rack—no matter; this is the Player who keeps it running and comes up with on the fly solutions when unexpected tech problems crop up. The Medtech: Because sometimes things do go wrong, and you end up full of holes this Role needs to patch up. The Job may also involve kidnapping, extraction or some other element that will have a medical function. (Like how much sodium pentathol should we give this guy to find out where he hid the microchip we want?) 394 RUNNING CYBERPUNK The Ninja: This role is usually a variation of a Solo, but one who specializes in getting into places and silently taking out the opposition. They’re also compe- tent muscle, but they’re usually sneakier about it. The Face: This Role is the Player who deliberately puts themselves out in front of the target of a Job. Sometimes they’re there as a distraction. Sometimes they’re there to pump the opposition for info. Sometimes they’re the one to smooth talk the bad guys into doing something advantageous for the team. Rockers are naturally good at playing the Face role; they can often rely on a guard or secretary to be too starstruck by their arrival to think clearly. The Driver: This is the Player who pro- vides the transport. Probably best as a Nomad, as that’s the Role with the most vehicular options. You may also have to drive several types of vehicles in a single caper. The Muscle: This Player provides raw strength and violence. Often whomever is best at hand-to-hand beatdowns. If a Player doesn’t fit one of the other Roles on the Caper Crew, they can probably find something to do as the Muscle. The Killer: This Role also deals with vio- lence, but usually using guns, swords, or other types of weapons. They’re the snipers, hit men, and drive-by guys who take out the guards or the rival gangs. The Scrounger: This Player is there to come up with whatever the Caper Crew is going to need; a good place for a Fixer, a Tech, or an Exec. He always has a cousin who knows a guy who has a brother, who knows a guy whose uncle can turn up with something useful, no matter how obscure it is. How they got it? Don’t ask. side QuesT ideas Here are a few good Side Quest concepts to get your brain churning. Perhaps the Characters come into possession of a piece of experimental tech and quickly discover that the Corp—or Tech—who built it has hired a Crew of Solos to get it back. Now the PCs get to decide what to do with it. Maybe the Crew gets hired by the NCPD to help hunt down a dangerous cyberpsycho who's been killing civilians across Night City. The problem? This psycho's stealthy and methodical. If you happen to have a Nomad in the Crew, they could receive word from their Pack that a close family member's gone rogue and must be hunted down. Now the Nomad Character has to decide whether they're going to hunt down their packmate or try to figure out what happened. A new musical act hits Night City and hires the PCs to act as muscle and support while they play their gigs. Build two or three interesting Rockerboys and their manager and let your Crew get to know them as they defend the band from the dangers of Night City. ADD some twists A good adventure will have many twists, turns, and unexpected events. We use an ascending arc of danger/opportunity as the way to propel the Main Plot. it’s AlwAys PeRsonAl The Main Plot should always be personal, but may eventually involve larger world threats. In other words, the Crew might find themselves involved in a major fight between two Corps but they should have an intimate and personal reason for getting involved. If you need a hook, don't forget their Lifepaths. Those are full of good ways to snag a Character. The start of each \"story spike\" can begin based on orientation of individual Character roles. Technical: New technology or using Tech Skills to fix a problem. Combat: A threat or other physical danger (like in an action movie) Persuasion: Conning or otherwise getting around danger without throwing fists or playing with gadgets. Don't lose the mAin Plot No matter how big the plot gets, Jabba the Hutt still wants his 5,000 credits. And he will keep showing up with bigger and bigger threats to get it. (After all, it is personal.) somethinG FoR eveRyone Side Quests are linked to main plots for each Player Type. However, you can also look at doing Side Quests that fall between two or more Types. Side Quests are a great way to add depth to a story and help it extend beyond a basic plo- tline. Who knows, you might even get some Character development out of it! 395 RUNNING CYBERPUNK B eat Charts maximum mike'S Secret weapon You’ve got Edgerunners and an idea for your Cyberpunk RED campaign. Now it’s time to write the Script. sCRiPtinG the GAme Whether for a show, movie, or RPG adventure, you need a script to tell you where the action’s going. And pacing is the most important part of that script. You not only have to tell a story, but also break it up into manageable chunks for your Edgerunners. Each \"chunk\" of story should convey information, be entertaining, and help provide excitement by pushing the plot along in some visible way. One way to do this is by using a writing trick called a Beat Chart; a framework in which certain actions or scenes take place in a certain order. The order of the scenes helps both maintain dramatic tension and allows the storyline to make sense. Each Beat Chart has five aspects, or Beats: the Hook, the Development, the Cliffhanger, the Climax, and the Resolution. Some Beats, like the Hook, Climax, and Resolution occur only once. Other Beats, like the Development and the Cliffhanger, are used over and over, but in alternating order. There are Three Rules for Setting up a Beat Chart 1. The story always begins with a Hook. The Hook is a short piece of action or suspense that is used to involve the reader, viewer, or Edgerunner in the story. 2. The story always ends on a Climax, fol- lowed by a Resolution. The Climax is the big finale of the story—the battle where the protag- onists complete their mission (maybe), or where the murderer is revealed. The Resolution is the tag line: it’s the part at the end that tells what happens as a result of the Climax. It’s the part in the show or movie where we see the supposedly dead antagonist flying away in their AV, the Nomad Pack driving off into the night, or the protagonists living (as much as anyone can in the Time of the Red) happily ever after. 3. Alternate Developments and Cliffhangers throughout the story. Developments are basi- cally non-action Beats that move the story along; they involve clues, revelations, conversations, and Character Developments. Cliffhangers are always action scenes: chases, dogfights, battles, and so on. Developments and Cliffhangers always appear in alternating order; you should never have two Cliffhangers or two Developments in a row. As a general rule, if your Hook has a lot of action and battle, you’ll start the rest of the story with a Development; if the Hook was more cerebral and inactive, you’ll want to start with a Cliffhanger to liven things up. You also want to make sure to end on a Development if your Climax is on active one, and a Cliffhanger if your Climax is more mental. A beAt ChARt exAmPle Let’s take a look at a Beat Chart with the Beats in place, in this case, from the opening story of this book, Never Fade Away. You can reread it on pg. 5. Hook: The story starts with a Cliffhanger, in which Johnny and Alt are attacked. Johnny goes down and Alt is Kidnapped. Development: After he’s patched up, Johnny meets Thompson who provides information in the form of a Revelation. Johnny learns who kidnapped Alt (Arasaka) and why (they want her to make a new Soulkiller). Cliffhanger: Johnny and Thompson travel to the Atlantis to recruit Rogue and Nomad Santiago. The meet gets interrupted by Arasaka agents and a Battle breaks out. Development: The focus switches to Alt, who wakes up in the office of Toshiro, an Arasaka exec who launches into a Monologue about why she was kidnapped. Cliffhanger: While they fought off the first wave of attackers, Johnny and crew know they are the subject of a Pursuit by a force much bigger than 396 RUNNING CYBERPUNK theirs. They run away and take refuge on a fire escape and try to figure a way out of their present predicament. Development: Alt and Johnny hit the Advantage Revealed Development at the same time. He shows how his music can inspire and direct legions by raising a mob and unleashing them on Arasaka Tower. Alt, meanwhile, cooperates with Arasaka and creates a new Soullkiller, but ensures it will remain loyal to her. Climax: The Final Battle happens on two fronts. Johnny and friends take advantage of the chaos to slip into the building and fight their way to where Alt's being held. Alt, meanwhile, uses Soulkiller to brain fry the Techs watching her and steal a whole lot of money. Resolution: Johnny arrives, and; in the commotion, connections are cut. Alt can’t return to her body and becomes a ghost in the machine. Johnny kills Toshiro but, in the end, this is a Pyrrhic Victory. As you can see, the Beat Chart for a story is designed to make sure all the scenes happen in an orderly manner, and that things stay interesting throughout. If our protagonists moved from fighting one group of opponents in the Atlantis to fighting another group of opponents on the street, you’d groan and ask, \"Is that all they ever do?\" Likewise, if Johnny spent the entire first half of the episode staring at a screen while he researched Arasaka, you’d get bored and wander off. A good Beat Chart keeps a balance of action to introspection and makes everything flow smoothly. mAkinG A beAt ChARt Grab a scrap of paper (or the digital equivalent), and quickly jot down a rough idea of the Beat Chart for your adventure. You know you’ll start with a Hook, and end on a Climax and a Resolution. But how many Developments and Cliffhangers are you going to need? One way to determine this is to decide just how long you want your adventure to be. A good rule of thumb is that each Beat in the chart should take about one half-hour of game play. Your Hook, Climax, and Resolution automatically account for one-and-a- half-hours; subtract this from the total hours of play, then divide this remainder between Developments and Cliffhangers. 1 Beat = ½ Hour of Real-World TimeBY NEIL BRANQUINHO 397 RUNNING CYBERPUNK For example, say your typical one-night game is about six hours. Subtracting one-and-a-half-hours from this gives you four-and-a-half-hours remaining; enough for several Developments and/or Cliffhangers. Decide (in a general way, since you haven’t started to plot things out yet), whether you want to start on a Development or Cliffhanger, and which type of Beat you want to end on. Number the list in order of appearance and you’ve got a Beat Chart. A Few GooD beAts In this section, we’ve listed some of the all-time best Beats; Beats found in shows, movies, books, and plays throughout entertainment history. Start by picking the type of Beat (Hook, Cliffhanger, Development, Climax, or Resolution) that you’ll need for each part of your Beat Chart. Next, read each Beat listed under that area for ideas and possible directions to take that Beat. With a little imagination, you’ll be surprised at how fast you can construct an interesting story line! ▶ The Hook ◀ The Hook is how you get your Edgerunners involved. It can involve any type of situation which poses an immedi- ate threat or interest to the Edgerunners. An ambush could be a Hook. So could finding a suitcase full of Eurobucks. Both situations get the Edgerunners involved and moving. A Hook need not be directly connected to the main plotline; it can be a self-contained scene, just as long as it does its job: wake the Edgerunners up. For example: in the movie Raiders of the Lost Ark, the opening scene where the hero breaks into the tomb is a Hook. It tells the audience that Indy does interesting things, that he has enemies, and that the pace of action will be fast and frenetic. No one ever leaves Raiders to get some popcorn in the lobby after this scene. The Hook is what you’ll use to get your Edgerunners into the adventure fast. Its sole reason for existence is to start the action rolling and make things interest- ing from the beginning of the Game. You don’t want to waste time with all the Edgerunners fumbling around trying to decide what to do. Instead, you Hook them and reel in the line. ▶ CoRonet blue The name of this Hook is taken from on old ‘60s TV show in which the hero wakes up to find he cannot remember his identity, yet everyone he meets knows him and assumes he knows the score. In this Hook, the Edgerunners awake in some type of dangerous or difficult situation. They have no memory of how they got there or who they are expected to be. Meanwhile, friends and enemies alike treat them as though the Edgerunners know the whole thing. ▶ CRisis The Edgerunners are immediately embroiled in an ongoing crisis; a disaster that extends beyond just their immediate sphere of influence to the whole city or maybe even the entire world. A war between Corps has spilled out onto the streets, booster gangs are spilling out of the Combat Zone in an orgy of destruc- tion, an earthquake is shaking everything to the ground, or plague is killing every- one in sight. The Crisis begins the moment the Edgerunners walk into the Game and doesn’t let up for a moment until they either escape or set out to stop it. Once again, it’s important that the Crisis Hook relate directly to the Game; the boostergangers are being goaded by the Edgerunner’s enemies, or the Antagonist has caused the earthquake using a new Corp-funded drilling device. an examPLe beaT charT My Beat Chart by CyberBob HOOK: How about we start with a Discovery? The Edgerunners find an encrypted Memory Chip in a bar. C L I F F H AN G E R : O h no! An Ambush! Some booster gangers attack! DEVELOPMENT: Now, a Warning. An old but Skilled Netrunner joins the fight. Once the gangers are mopped up, she tells the Edgerunners the Memory Chip contains information that’ll take down the local branch of Biotechnica. They’ll need to take it to a data specialist on the out- skirts of the city to decrypt it. She’s willing to pay them to accompany her. CLIFFHANGER: Time for a good old Pursuit. The Edgerunners are chased by booster gangers riding some sweet motorcycles. DEVELOPMENT:Give the PCs an Advantage to help them out.

Continued on page 398. 398 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ DisCoveRy This Hook marks an adventure started by an important discovery. The Edgerunners might find a lost piece of pre-War tech, or a datafile filled with dangerous infor- mation. In all cases, the Discovery Hook should directly link into some important element of the later Game (the datafile is the key to unlocking a vault that belonged to a Crew member’s parent, or that long- lost tech they found is something their Corp Antagonist wants, badly). ▶ FAlse ACCusAtion In this Hook, the Edgerunners are falsely accused of a heinous (or not so heinous) crime. A Fixer sends goons after them because \"They stole from my Night Market!\" A seemingly terrified Corp rushes up to one of the Edgerunners and points him out to a nearby NCPD officer as their attacker. A man falls dead in an Edgerunner’s arms, a monoblade sticking out of his body. Anything that could get the Edgerunners into major trouble is laid (undeservingly) at their doorstep. The important part is that the accusation be unfounded and that the Edgerunner be given only a limited number of options: fight (against impossible odds) or flee (with everyone in the world after them). ▶ kiDnAPPeD In this Hook, the Edgerunners are either kidnapped by an unknown force, or one of their friends is kidnapped. The unknown force should be mysterious and far more powerful than the Edgerunners (the idea here is to begin the Game with the kid- napping, setting the Scene for the next actions). ▶ loominG thReAt This Hook immediately places the Edgerunners in a situation similar to the Crisis Hook. However, in the Looming Threat the actual danger hasn’t broken over their heads yet. There are mysterious portents, and an aura of dread pervades the air. In the Looming Threat Hook, the Booster Gangs haven’t hit the streets yet, but they’re all massing in their strongholds, psyching themselves up. The Corps are massing armies in their headquarters, and everyone knows it’s just a matter of time. The plague hasn’t started yet, but dozens of people have all died from a mysterious and horrible disease. Once again, the Threat should be directly related to the Game’s plotline. ▶ muRDeR This Hook begins with a murder, either of a friend/relative/ally of the Edgerunners, or of an obviously innocent victim. The murder can occur either near the Edgerunners, or the victim can be discov- ered by them. In no case may you allow the Edgerunners to actually capture the murderer in question; the aim is to link the murder into the subsequent Game. ▶ PlAy A CliFFhAnGeR A Hook can also begin with a furious action scene (most action shows begin like this). The best Cliffhanger Beats to play are Confrontation, Ambush, or Fist Fight. A Cliffhanger Beat should serve to propel the Edgerunners immediately into the Game’s plotline, by introducing them to either their opposition or their allies. ▶ PlAy A DeveloPment You can also elect to play a Development Beat as a Hook (this is a common tactic in mystery and crime shows). The best options for this are: Secret Meeting, Mistaken Identity, Romance, or Treachery. Once again, your choice should imme- diately propel the Edgerunners into the Game’s plotline and introduce major allies or opponents. For example, an Edgerunner could fall in love with a an examPLe beaT charT (conTinued) CLIFFHANGER: Doesn't a Confrontation sound good? A Biotechnica Operative contacts the Edgerunners and tells them to hand over the Memory Chip or something terrible will happen. DEVELOPMENT: Now for the twist! Dun. Dun. Dun!!! A Lie Revealed! The Edgerunners overhear the old Netrunner talking to someone on her Agent. It turns out the Memory Chip is actually an elec- tronic key to a buried vault where samples of a nasty bioweapon were stored during the 4th Corporate War. The Netrunner is a nihilist cultist and wants to release the bioweapon into the city. CLIMAX: Final Battle! The Edgerunners fight the Netrunner and her drone army just outside the vault, defeating her and prevent- ing the bioweapon from being released. RESOLUTION: A Happy Ending. The Biotechnica Operative offers to pay the Edgerunners well for the Memory Chip and lets them watch as the vault’s last-resort mechanism is activated, and the bio- weapon is destroyed by an intense blaze. 399 RUNNING CYBERPUNK Nomad they’ll ally with later, be betrayed by a friendly force, or find themselves en route to a secret meeting with their opponent. ▶ RevelAtion The Revelation Hook represents a previously hidden fact that will dramatically change the Edgerunners’ lives. A Revelation could include an unexpected inheritance, a secret past, mysterious parentage revealed, or an unpurgeable virus in their cyberware. In this Hook, the revelation will directly be linked to the Game in some way or another. (\"You’re probably wondering why I called you all here…\") ▶ Cliffhanger ◀ A Cliffhanger is defined as: \"A contest whose outcome is in doubt up to the very end.\" All Cliffhangers involve physical conflict or peril of some sort. A Cliffhanger can take many forms: a car chase, a dogfight, a sword duel, or even a fist fight. Cliffhangers serve two purposes in your script: they speed up the plo- tline by increasing the pace, and they wake up the audience by interjecting a note of danger. Sure, it may be important that the hero discover the secret mind control weapon in the basement, but the monster guarding the secret mind control weapon is a far more exciting problem. A problem only combat can resolve. You don’t want to pile Cliffhanger on top of Cliffhanger; your audience will get tired of unrelenting battles pretty fast. Also, Cliffhanger after Cliffhanger begins to dull the impact of danger and excitement. The best rule of Cliffhangers is to keep them short, deadly, and with the threat of defeat (or death) right up front. Another ground rule of Cliffhangers is to save the best for last. At the start of a script, the Edgerunners are unknown quantities—a few short battles will tell both them and their opponents, their strengths and weaknesses. This is when you send out a reasonable force of bad guys that the Edgerunners can defeat unless they do something stupid. Once they’ve got the hang of it, you want to raise the ante enough to make the Edgerunners and the audience a little more worried; can they defeat this stronger foe? By the end of the script, you want to hit them with the toughest thing you’ve got; but hopefully, they’ve now defeated the Antagonist’s henchmen and have the anti-FBC gun they need in order to defeat (barely) the Big Threat. ▶ Ambush Generally, this Cliffhanger is much like a Battle: two sides meet and have a fight. But in an Ambush, one side always gets a first free shot before its opposition can respond. There are two ways to play this. If the intent is to have the Edgerunners stage an Ambush, the Gamemaster should set the stage so that it’s obvious that their opposition is nearby and completely unaware of the Edgerunners’ presence. Whatever happens after this is up to them. In most cases, however, when this Cliffhanger is played against the Edgerunners the opposition drops out of nowhere, and the Edgerunners must make a successful Awareness check against their opponent’s Stealth to know the Ambush is coming. ▶ bAttle This Cliffhanger is played when a full-out, formal combat is staged. A Battle differs from an Ambush in that both sides are fully aware of the battle to come and meet openly. Unlike a Duel, all the participants can join in at any time: it’s a combat free for all. When playing this Cliffhanger, you’ll want to scale each sub- sequent Battle (you might have several in the course of a Game) at higher and higher levels. For example, if you have three battles, the first one should be with mere Mooks, the next with Lieutenants, and the next one with the Mini Boss. To make this easier, we have set up the following examples of battles in order of appearance: Battle 1: Mooks. These types are usually of lesser Skill than the Edgerunners and it’s safe to throw an equal number of Mooks at the Crew (if there are 4 Edgerunners, there are 4 Mooks). If the Crew has several combat-oriented Characters, you can generally have the Mooks outnumber the Crew 2-to-1. Battle 2: Lieutenants. These enemies are usually of equal or slightly greater Skill than the Edgerunners. For every 2 Edgerunners there should be 1 Lieutenant. If you need to make things interesting, have the Lieutenants round out their forces with Mooks so there’s a number of antagonists equal to the number of Edgerunners (keep in mind that each Lieutenant counts as 2 Edgerunners). 400 RUNNING CYBERPUNK Battle 3: Mini Bosses. The best the opposition can throw at the Edgerunners now makes their appear- ance. They are always substantially more powerful, skill-wise, than the Edgerunners. Each Mini Boss counts as 3 Edgerunners making them a very difficult fight. Generally, a Mini Boss will be accompanied by a number of Lieutenant and Mooks needed to make the opposition equal the Crew. 1 Mook = 1 Edgerunner 1 Lieutenant = 2 Edgerunners 1 Mini Boss = 3 Edgerunners Keep in mind that sometimes the answer isn’t throwing more enemies at your Players but giving the enemies you’re using better gear. A Mook can be far more dangerous if they trade in their Poor Quality Pistol for a Malorian Arms 3516. This can also go in the other direction. When your Players start getting ahold of high powered gear they’ll probably be able to punch above their weight. You may want to start treating Characters with powerful weapons or cyber- ware as 2 or even 3 Edgerunners for the purposes of building encounters. ▶ ChAse The Crew engages in a hot pursuit of the opposition. Obviously, you aren’t going to be able to get the Edgerunners to follow anyone unless they’ve got a good reason. This Cliffhanger is best used right after a Kidnapping or Revelation. ▶ ConFRontAtion A Confrontation is a non-physical fight—a scene where the Edgerunners face the opposition on a verbal combat level. Threats are exchanged and intimidation resorted to. Either one side backs down or both do. The Confrontation Cliffhanger is a tough one to play; the opposition should have an overwhelming advantage over the Edgerunners yet choose not to exploit it in combat. A good example is the scene where the Antagonist‘s minions come to the Edgerunners and tell them to \"Get outta town by sundown, or else.\" Unless the Edgerunners push it, the opposition isn’t going to attack just then. The idea is to simply lean on the Edgerunners and give them a reason to want to beat up their enemies when they finally get the chance. ▶ Contest A contest is some type of ritualized confronta- tion, in which one side wins and one side loses. A Contest could involve riddles, feats of strength, feats of memory, or cleverness, or any other type of one-on-one competition. Note: You may not use a Gamemaster fiat to allow the NPC to win a Contest; this should come down to roleplay and the rolls and the Edgerunners should always have a chance at victory. ▶ DoGFiGht A Dogfight is any Cliffhanger that involves vehicular combat; this could be a battle of flying vehicles like the name suggests, but also motorcycles, cars, or even boats. A Dogfight Action gets played when you want to have the opposition attempt to shoot down the Edgerunners. ▶ Duel A Duel is a one-on-one combat between two par- ticipants. Weapons are usually of equal power and lethality (for example, a sword vs. a dagger would be considered a Battle, not a duel). Duels do not have to be to the death in most cases, the object is to prove who’s the better combatant between the two parties. A Duel can also be used to ritually decide the outcome of a situation: if A wins, B agrees to do something A wants. In the world of Cyberpunk, some bars have combat pits to help settle things between individuals, so violence doesn’t erupt in the streets. ▶ Fist FiGht In this Cliffhanger, the Edgerunners (or a single champion of the Edgerunners) meets the Opposition in hand-to-hand combat. This doesn’t have to be an actual fist fight; it can be any contest where physical, weaponless combat can take place. Wrestling, kung fu, and fisticuffs are all acceptable. The rules of the combat are often ritualized in some way (inside a circle, one hand behind the back, salt thrown at the opponent). GMs, you can find stats for Mooks, Lieutenants, and Mini Bosses on page 412BY ADRIAN MARC 401 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ monsteR Monsters are a special type of Cliffhanger. Monsters are non-intelligent threats to the Edgerunners: the drone guarding the office building, the automated turrets on the wall, or the horde of mini drones in the hallway. ▶ obstACles Obstacles are traps, hazards, or other dangers the Edgerunners must physically overcome. The great part about obstacles is that they’re pretty generic—you can move them from adventure to adventure with only a little window dressing. Obstacles can be lethal or non-lethal. Non- lethal obstacles are usually deadfalls, snares, or another type of confinement designed to capture the Edgerunners or subject them to a situation in which they must either perceive and defeat the trap before it is sprung, or escape the trap after they have walked into it. Examples include a booby-trapped hallway with dropdown walls or a closed room filling with knockout gas. Lethal obstacles are similar but can cause real harm and even death. Lethal obstacles include an electrified fence, the crumbling floor of an old building, and a timebomb that started ticking down the moment the Edgerunners entered the room. It must be possible to overcome an Obstacle. In the case of traps set by enemies, clues to help the Edgerunners overcome them must be present, either in the scene in which the Obstacle is played or in an earlier scene. ▶ PuRsuit The Edgerunners are chased by the opposition, who have superior force on their side. This Cliffhanger works best when you make it really obvious that the enemy has far superior numbers and will do bad things to the Edgerunners if they don’t run. ▶ RACe The Edgerunners must race the opposition to reach a goal first. The goal can be a person, place, or thing. This is best played after some type of Revelation or Discovery Development, which gives the Edgerunners a better sense of the stakes and a reason to win the race. 402 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ skiRmish! The Crew engages in a small battle with the opposi- tion. If the Crew is winning, the opposition escapes via trickery (smoke bombs, leaping onto the back of a passing truck, etc.). If the Crew is losing, the opposition is content to capture them or leave them wounded but alive. ▶ Development ◀ A Development is a scene where the plot moves ahead without a physical conflict. Also known as the \"bump,\" it is the part of the script that sets the direction of action until the next big Development. For example, in Lord of the Rings, Gandalf the Wizard’s visit to Frodo to tell him about the Ring is a Development. The direction of action is set; Frodo and his companions must find a way to destroy the Ring or face the destruction of Middle Earth. A Development can also be used to give the Edgerunners a clue, pass on information, warn of danger, or reveal a previously unknown aspect of the plot. For example, in the movie Casablanca, the return of Ilse Lund to Rick’s Cafe is a Development that forces the cynical Rick to help the Resistance. Another way Developments are used is to give the Edgerunners clues on how to gain advantage against their foes. In the movie Star Wars IV: A New Hope, meeting Obi Wan Kenobi is the Development Luke Skywalker must pass through in order to learn the ways of the Force, and thus be able to blow up the Death Star. Developments can also lead to new Developments: Luke meeting Ben in order to learn about the Force leads him to eventually travel to Dagobah in order to train under Yoda, which in turn leads to his discovery that Darth Vader is indeed his father. ▶ ADvAntAGe ReveAleD The Edgerunners uncover a previously unknown ability, advantage, tool, or weapon in their quest. Examples are the piece of pile that is really a powerful weapon when assembled, a new, specialized piece of cyberware, or knowledge of a technique that didn’t seem all that important at first (how to weave baskets under water). ▶ AlliAnCe This Development represents gaining help from outside sources: an experienced Solo takes up your cause, the locals are swayed into giving you aid, etc. The Alliance Development will always give the Edgerunners a new \"manpower\" resource to use in their mission. Allies should be powerful, but not enough to tip the battle’s outcome by themselves. ▶ bACk FRom the DeAD An old opponent returns from a supposed death. Like the Second Chance, this is a tough Beat to play: you must devise a reasonable excuse for how the old enemy escaped their doom (the AV crashed in the water, the wound only looked like a death stroke, etc.). Only use this once, and it’s best used when the Edgerunners have overwhelmingly defeated the bad guys early in the game and you want the Final Battle to be a challenge. ▶ betRAyAl The Party’s been betrayed! It could be a trusted ally, a lover, or their local bartender. A Betrayer can be anyone involved with the Party. What form will the Betrayal take? Maybe the Party’s plans are revealed to the opposition. Maybe the betrayer helps the oppo- sition set up an ambush (or drugs the Edgerunners so that they can be captured). Maybe they kidnap an important NPC and turn them over to the Antagonists as a hostage. Or even steal the gadget needed to defeat the enemy. A Betrayal should always allow the Edgerunners a chance to catch the Betrayer in the act or find them soon afterward to enact revenge. ▶ Clue An ambiguous Revelation. One part of the puzzle is revealed, but not the whole thing. With a Clue, the Edgerunners learn only that ‘’Someone is buying or stealing up all the loose radioactive material in the city,\" instead of \"Inquisitors are acquiring all the radio- active material they can find because they’ve decided to cleanse the city in fire by building and detonating a nuclear device.\" BY RICHARD BAGNALL 403 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ FoReshADowinG Like Warnings, the foreshadowing Development gives warning of events to come. However, the warnings are always ambiguous and hazy: instead of saying \"Watch out for Corp agents,\" Foreshadowing says \"Be wary of anyone with an expensive haircut.\" This Development can be played at almost any time but shouldn’t be played immediately before the event (as you’re going to want some time for the suspense to build). Foreshadowing can be used in a number of ways: the Antagonists may meet the Edgerunners in a non-threatening situation, or someone may warn the Edgerunners about the Antagonist. Foreshadowing is unique in that it can encompass messages from the NET and obscure hints. The nature of the threat is not obviously explained. ▶ FRAmeD! The Party (or a member of the Party) is set up for a crime they didn’t commit. The frame should be obvious to everyone except the authorities (who will have con- vincing evidence to the contrary). ▶ GAin mAsteRy This Development represents a period of learning or improvement: a long session with a teacher or master, special training from a skilled source, study, or long practice. The Edgerunners spend weeks in a training camp with an old Militech Drill Sergeant, or travel to a Nomad encampment to learn to drive from Nomad Santiago himself. At the end of the Mastery period, they will possess the skills needed to win the Game, if they use them wisely. It’s best to compress time in this Development: don’t cover each moment of every day, just the high spots (training montage!). ▶ hAZARDous quest The Edgerunners are forced to embark on a journey of hazardous proportions to destroy, find, or recover something. The way will be long and arduous, with obstacles everywhere. There may be terrible storms or other deadly environmental conditions. In the Hazardous Quest Beat, any combat or attacks will be of a minor nature unrelated to their Opposition: wild animals, old drones, random gangers. A hazardous 404 RUNNING CYBERPUNK journey can, however, start, be interrupted by, or end with a Battle, Ambush, Trap, or other combat-related Beat. ▶ hesitAtion The Hesitation Development is much like the Retreat; the opposition breaks off its attack without warning. However, they do not quit the field. Instead, they may pause to negotiate a temporary truce. A typical version of this is the old, \"Hrrmm. You guys are a lot better than I expected. I’m impressed. Perhaps you would be willing to work with me.\" Note that in most cases, should the Edgerunners go along with them, the Antagonist will betray or backstab them at the earliest opportunity. ▶ lie ReveAleD Something previously thought to be true turns out to be a lie! This could be a clue, a piece of information, the identity of an NPC, or any other vital fact. The Revealed Lie does not automatically reveal the truth; it just becomes clear to the Edgerunners that what they were originally told is untrue. ▶ mistAken iDentity One (or more) of the Edgerunners is mistaken for (or poses as) someone else. The identity will always be that of on important person; however, it may be a good or bad guy. \"Aren’t you the PopMedia celeb/ the Boss’s kid/my old lover?\" With the mistaken identity can come problems, advantages, or infor- mation, which can be played as Developments after this is played. For example, if everyone thinks an Edgerunner is the Long-Lost, Presumed Dead Rache Bartmoss, this may provoke Rache’s (many) enemies to attack as soon as possible. Later, Rache’s roman- tic (?) interest may show up with information for the same Edgerunner. Use this Development carefully—it’s dynamite. ▶ monoloGue The leader of the opposition is in a talkative mood. Like Antagonists everywhere, they have the need to brag about the Master Plan; what the Goal is, how it will be accomplished, etc. This Development is only played when the Edgerunners are totally in the Antagonist’s control, after a Kidnapping, Trap, or Confrontation. The bad guys feel like it won’t matter: the Edgerunners are going to die or serve them anyway, so why not make them sweat? ▶ not whAt it seems An action in a previous Beat is not as it was origi- nally perceived. Friends may turn out to be enemies, something harmful is actually good, etc. A classic example is the ally who changes sides in one Beat, then is discovered to be infiltrating the opposition as a double agent. This is a tough Development to play, as it requires that the Gamemaster knows the true meaning of the original action and makes it obvious that the change was intended all along. ▶ obsession A member of the Party is the target of another Character’s obsession. This obsession may be for love, hate, or curiosity. The obsessed Actor will do their best to follow the object of obsession around, trying to stay close to them. They will not attack the Edgerunners and will avoid confrontation whenever possible. ▶ PeRsonAl stAke This Development raises the ante of the Game by interjecting a Personal Stake into the action. Examples would include one of the Edgerunners being poisoned, with the only vial of the antidote being in the hands of the opposition; an Edgerunner’s friend or lover being kidnapped by the Antagonist; the Edgerunners learning that their enemy set them up in some way and the only way to clear their names is to get the real culprit, etc. ▶ PuZZle A riddle is posed to the Edgerunners—something that must be solved before they can move on. It can be any type of riddle or puzzle. Unlike a Contest, a Puzzle does not involve two sides, it is merely placed before the Edgerunners, who must then solve it before they can escape, get into the Corp HQ, learn the Antagonist’s secret, etc. Like a Trap, a Puzzle must always have a solution, and clues to that solution must either be present in the same Scene or in a Scene that has already occurred. 405 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ ResCueRs! The Edgerunners must save someone from capture, death, or confinement. The important part of this Beat is to provide a compelling reason for the rescue to take place. Maybe the victim is a friend or has infor- mation the party needs to succeed. ▶ RetReAt Usually played after a Cliffhanger. For an unknown reason, the Edgerunner’s opponents are suddenly forced to break off an Attack, Ambush, or other action, and retreat to their current stronghold. As a Gamemaster, it’s up to you to decide the reasons for this sudden reversal. Perhaps there has been a setback or betrayal in the enemy camp, a hostile third party is on their way, or the opposition has realized that the fight will not serve its original purpose. When a retreat is played, the enemy will always seek to cover their tracks with some delaying tactic that makes it impossible for the Edgerunners to immediately follow: collapsing a stairway, dropping a cluster of grenades, or weaving into impossible to navigate traffic. ▶ ReveAleD weAkness A Revealed Weakness shows the Edgerunners some previously unknown weakness of their opposition. The weakness could be physical, mental (a hidden fear or phobia), a special weapon or Tool which can be used against the opposition, or a traitor within the enemy’s camp. A Revealed Weakness is always clearly described: \"The Dragoon Full Body Conversion unit is a combat monster but there’s a flaw in the casing around the power core that can be penetrated by a solid shot.\" ▶ RevelAtion A Revelation is played when a key piece of infor- mation is uncovered. Revelations don’t tell the Edgerunners the same things as a Hidden Weakness or Clue. Instead, in a Revelation, they discover the entire story—all of what’s going on in one shot. It’s not merely a clue, like \"Someone is buying up or stealing all the radioactive material in the city,\" but rather, \"The Inquisitors are acquiring all the radioactive material they can find because they’ve decided to cleanse the city in fire by building and detonating a nuclear device.\" Revelations should only be used when you really want the Edgerunners to know the whole story and this knowledge won’t affect the outcome in any critical way. ▶ RomAnCe Ah, love! (We couldn’t resist.) In this Development, Romance comes to one or more of the Edgerunners when someone takes a strong liking to them. This doesn’t have to be all hearts and flowers, though: a new lover can come complete with secret alliances to the Edgerunner’s enemy, jealous suitors, angry parents, hidden secrets, or a lethal and incur- able disease. ▶ sAbotAGe! An important weapon, piece of cyberware, or vehicle of the Party’s is disabled by sabotage. Like the Betrayal Development, the party should have a chance to detect the sabotage and avert/repair it. ▶ seConD ChAnCe This represents another crack at the problem. The Edgerunners have suffered a major setback in some way (they were unprepared or just missed the clues). This Development can be played to \"save\" a disin- tegrating game; Allies appear with new information, new clues are revealed, or comrades previously thought dead may be brought back by an act of divine intervention (or scriptwriting; i.e.; \"When Harry’s AV crashed, he ejected at the last moment, but was knocked out and lost his memory, but then he recov- ered and has rejoined the Crew.\"). This is a very powerful Development to play, and should be deployed with extreme care. ▶ seCRet meetinG A secret meeting is called, in which the Edgerunners can gain new allies or information. Secret Meetings are usually played before a Clue, Revelation, or Alliance Development. A Beat can be played between the two Developments (the Meeting is broken up by an Ambush or some other type of conflict). Most of the action in this Development comes from setting up, reaching, and meeting people at the Meeting. 406 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ stRAnGe beDFellows A common threat suddenly forces the Crew to ally with the opposition. This works best when the enemy suddenly shows up and says, \"We have a common problem and need to work together.\" The common threat must be both compelling and convincing for this Beat to work. ▶ tuRnAbout! One member of the opposition decides (for their own reasons), to aid the Crew. Classic examples of this would be the underling who betrays the Antagonist in order to get their job, or the opponent who joins the Edgerunners because they fall in love with one of them. This is a good way to balance the odds when the Crew has been reduced in strength and needs some support. ▶ venGeAnCe! One member of the Crew becomes the target of the opposition’s vengeance. Maybe it’s something the Edgerunner did. Maybe the bad guy just doesn’t like the Edgerunner’s face. In any conflict, this enemy will make a point of attacking or challenging this Edgerunner, no matter what the risk. ▶ wARninG The Warning Development tells the Edgerunners of something to come, or of a threat they may not be aware of. Warnings are mysterious voices in the NET, notes slipped under doors, or allies coming to the Edgerunners to tell them what’s about to happen. The main difference between a Warning and a Foreshadowing is that a Warning is always explicit: it tells the nature of the threat or problem, while a Foreshadowing gives only vague hints. ▶ Climax ◀ Climaxes are scenes that happen near the end (or sometimes at the end) of the Game. Thus, they are played last. The only other Scene that can follow a Climax is a Resolution. ▶ FinAl bAttle This is the big megillah, the last showdown between the Edgerunners and the enemy. In this one, you can feel free to bring in the Antagonist, their Henchmen, assorted Minions, and whatever Monsters or other Opposition forces you can muster. A Final Battle should be a dramatic free-for-all, with destruction meted out on a grand scale. Like the Final Revelation, the Final Battle wraps up the Game for the most part, the enemies are beaten, the love interest rescued, and the neighborhood saved. ▶ FinAl RevelAtion In the Final Revelation, the Edgerunners (and appro- priate NPCs) are gathered together in one place, and, like the participants in an Agatha Christie novel, must decide what is going on and expose the true facts. What has been going on must finally be revealed in its entirety: the Edgerunner’s learn about the Inquisition’s nuclear bomb plot, the murderer is revealed, or the enemy’s secret identity exposed. The outcome of this Revelation is already decided; once the killer is revealed, the police will arrest them, or once the Corp exec’s illicit business affairs are uncovered, they will slink away in disgrace. The goal of the Final Revelation is to merely uncover the underlying mystery. ▶ FinAl ACt Not every mission ends in a big reveal or a huge battle. Sometimes Edgerunners try for stealth and guile and actually succeed. This is especially true in heist adventures. In the Final Act Revelation, the Edgerunners enact their big plan to accomplish their goal. Example goals include stealing a piece of tech, planting a crippling virus in a Corp’s network, or placing the bomb that’ll wipe out an enemy gang’s headquarters once and for all. While the Final Act might involve fights or obstacles, they aren’t the main focus. Instead, the focus should be on how the pieces of the plan come together to help the Edgerunners complete the job. ▶ Resolution ◀ Resolutions are like the \"tag line\" of a show: they’re a tiny denouement in which plot ends are neatly tied up (or the possibilities of a sequel revealed). They may only be played as the final Beat in your script and are the result of all the other Beats. But how can that be, you ask? Didn’t the Final Battle Beat resolve things? Not necessarily. The Resolution Beat can overturn all other results of the Final Battle. 407 RUNNING CYBERPUNK ▶ AntAGonist esCAPes The Antagonist is Beaten, but not killed or locked away. They’ve got a secret bolt hole, or it really wasn’t them at all—it was a bodysculpted double. If this Scene is played, the Antagonist gets clean away: the Edgerunners have no way of tracing them and no way of recapturing them. They’re out there, waiting. A great way to re-use a major opponent, assuming that you don’t do it all the time. ▶ AntAGonist is killeD Take that, you slimy Corp Exec! Bang! Snicker-snack! The Antagonist is dead and the Gamemaster gets to hand out I.P.. A fairly common Resolution, especially if your Edgerunners are a bloodthirsty lot. ▶ AntAGonist toPPleD Another common resolution. The Edgerunners win and, while the Antagonist survives, the threat is neu- tralized. The murderer goes to prison, the Corp Exec gets transferred to a remote posting in shame, or the gang leader loses all their followers. This resolution offers a chance to use the Antagonist down the road but either as a minor threat (perhaps working for a new Antagonist) or as a different sort of challenge. ▶ eDGeRunneRs CAPtuReD This Beat is best played when the Edgerunners have really messed up, but you don’t want to kill them outright. Instead, they’re captured, and the adventure ends with them in durance vile, locked in a Corp jail or left adrift on the ocean. At this point, you have the option of starting a new Game or picking up where the old one left off. A hot Gamemaster tip: don’t imme- diately start the next Game. Instead, put the PCs in limbo, make them create all new Edgerunners, and run a totally different game first. Not only does this make the Players sweat out the fate of their Edgerunners, it buys you time to decide how you want to proceed after their upcoming daring escape! ▶ eDGeRunneRs esCAPe This Beat is best used when your Edgerunners are on the ropes and you don’t feel like killing them. Instead, you allow them to escape: an earthquake interrupts their losing battle, another force attacks and distracts the opposition, or an AV lands on the battlefield and an unknown person motions for them to hop in. The object is to save the Edgerunners for another round, because they really did do a good job. Like the Edgerunners Captured Resolution, you should make the Players sweat out another game first. Not a com- monly used option, and one to apply with great care. ▶ enDinG CliFFhAnGeR So, they beat the rival gang and kicked them out of their territory, huh? Just as the Edgerunners are about to break out the Smash and celebrate, a Nomad convoy rolls down the street and announces they’re taking over the neighborhood! The Ending Cliffhanger is another way to set up for a sequel but keep the tension on all the way. As with the Edgerunner Captured Resolution, you might consider spacing out the sequel with another, different game first. ▶ GReAteR thReAt So, you thought getting rid of the Antagonist ended the problem, eh? No; behind them stands a far greater threat! Sure, you took down the local Zhirafa head of security but that means you’ve attracted the attention of their boss or the gang leader you deposed was working for the Yakuza and now you have to deal with them. In this Scene, you discover that this is only the begin- ning, and another game lurks in the offing. ▶ hAPPy enDinG The Edgerunners win the day! In Cyberpunk, this could be a major victory like toppling a Corporation or minor victory like getting paid after finishing a mission. Any job you can walk away from, choomba. ▶ PyRRhiC viCtoRy The Edgerunners won, technically. They finished the job and they killed the Antagonist, but their victory came at a hefty price. Their HQ burned to the ground or an important NPC died during the final confronta- tion. Whatever the case, while they’re walking away winners, the Edgerunners shouldn’t feel like it. Be careful—while this victory feels very Cyberpunk it can be a tough act to follow. 408 RUNNING CYBERPUNK losinG the beAt In your average movie, the actors stick to the script and everyone knows what will happen next. Players in an RPG, on the other hand, are famous for surprising the GM. Just because you’ve set up a Beat Chart doesn’t mean the Players will follow it step by step. And trying to force them to, usually called \"railroading,\" isn’t much fun for you or them. Not to mention, RPGs like Cyberpunk rely on a certain amount of random luck to adjudicate the action. All it takes is a few bad rolls and suddenly your carefully planned Beat Chart might fall apart. What do you do then? Improvise. A good Beat Chart should be flexible. Sure, your Players might have lost a fight and not gotten the briefcase filled with secrets they needed from the enemy, but that doesn’t have to end the adventure. Ask yourself, can the Edgerunners find that information somewhere else? Is there a Fixer with the same data who’ll sell it at a cost? Or did some gangers ambush the enemy with the briefcase after the fight and steal it? With a stroke of a pen (or a few clicks of a keyboard) you can change your Clue Development from \"The Edgerunners find important documents in a briefcase they got from the baddies,\" to \"The Edgerunners have to track down the ganger who stole the briefcase and negotiate (or fight) for it.\" Just stay calm, be willing to change things up and, if you need it, call for a bio break to buy yourself time and rethink your Beat Chart. Who knows? Maybe the new direction will open up new possibilities as well! Remember, a Cyberpunk adventure isn’t \"GM Storytime\" but a collaborative effort everyone contributes to. G etting Better learning new SkillS and improving old oneS Assuming you live through everything the City has thrown at you, you're going to need to get better at what you do. Players can improve their Skills (or begin new ones) and Role Abilities by accumulating what we call Improvement Points (I.P.). As you gain more I.P., you'll record these points in the Improvement Point area of your character sheet. When you have collected enough Improvement Points you can raise the Level of a Skill or the Rank of your Role Ability.BY ANSELM ZIELONKA 409 RUNNING CYBERPUNK PlAystyle-bAseD imPRovement Unlike other tabletop games, Cyberpunk RED uses a system called Playstyle Improvement. This type of Improvement allows the GM to reward each player based on their preferred type of gameplay and their level of participation in that gameplay type. In classic Bartle Taxonomy, these types are Socializers, Explorers, Achievers and Killers. But in Cyberpunk RED, we describe the types as: • Warriors: Combat oriented Players like to engage in tests of skill against adversaries. They want to build the strongest fighter in the group, as well as have the best weapons or combat abilities. • Socializers: Social-oriented Players are all about the overall game experience. They like to tell jokes, record stories, and contribute in ways that are not directly within the game. In and out of the game, they tend to take supportive roles. • Explorers: Exploration oriented players like to find new things in the world. They like to make friends and alliances and find new places and things to experience. They also love to solve non-combat related puzzles and mysteries. • Roleplayers: Roleplay oriented Players like to concentrate on playing their character as accurately to type as possible. They enjoy constructing elaborate backgrounds for the character, often including personal props, pictures and even special diaries. They enjoy \"acting out\" important scenes with speeches or elaborate descriptions. ▶ What Type of Player Am I? ◀ But what kind of playstyle is yours? We figure this out by having each Player take a small quiz after they finish character creation. This helps both the GM and the Player to determine what playstyle best approximates their type. In the boxes below, the Player should choose the 5 things they find most important when playing. The box with the most circles is their primary play style. The box with the second most circles is their secondary play style. Defeat an enemy in battle. Gain a powerful tool or weapon. Prove your Skill in battle. The thrill of the hunt. Make the most powerful Character/tool. Establish a stronghold. Have a nemesis to beat. Find a new place on the map. Meet someone new in the world. Solve a difficult puzzle. Learn about the world and its Lore. Establish a place or alliance. Contribute to the history of the world. Reminice about a favorite game moment. Tell other people about the games you're in. Contribute to the success of the group. Team up to beat a challenge. Make friends outside of the game. Be part of the group. Have a picture of your Character. Write up your Character's background. Create extended family around your Character. Know about pets, favorite things, friends, and enemies. Act out the accents and mannerisms of your Character.WARRIORSSOCIALIZERSROLEPLAYERSEXPLORERS 410 RUNNING CYBERPUNK eARninG imPRovement Points After each game session, the GM awards all Players Improvement Points based on how successful they were in their mission. If the mission was finished (successfully or unsuccessfully), the Players gain Improvement Points based on their Group's success (taking the value from the Group Column) unless they did something that the GM considers stand out from one of the other playstyles that would award them more points. If the players didn't finish the mission, they are awarded I.P. based on either their Primary or Secondary Playstyle, unless they did something that the GM considers stand out from one of the other playstyles that would award them more points. For instance, if Bob Jones is a Warrior Type and he manages to defeat all of the dreaded Team X by luring them into a crossfire trap, that would fall under the \"very effective or clever use of combat skills, defeating several opponents in unexpected or unusual ways\" category. So, Bob would get 50 Playstyle I.P. for that feat. ▶ PlAystyle imPRovement Point tAble I.P.

These encounter tables are fast and nasty ways to keep your Players moving, thinking, and living in Cyberpunk RED. Just roll a percentage (2d10, with one represent- ing the tens’ place) to determine the outcome. Each listing refers to one of the ten NPCs on the previous section, sometimes with modifications. Remember, just because we give you STATS doesn’t mean each encounter should result in combat; use these as role- playing opportunities whenever possible. Feel free to alter the participants or the locale for extra variety. ReGionAl vARiAtion When using these Encounter Tables it’s important to keep in mind what part of the City you’re in. If you’re in a zone with a Moderate Threat Rating then it’s free game and any of these encounters could happen. But in the safer Zone with a Corporate Threat Rating you’re not gonna be running into gang wars and cyberpsychos. And if you wander into the Combat Zone or the Hot Zone you’re far more likely to run into trouble. When rolling for an encounter in a zone with a Corporate Threat Rating you’ll want to avoid Encounters at the higher end of the scale (Above 50) unless you really want a shake-up. Also keep in mind that in most cases, if a fire fight breaks out in these zones the Corporate police will arrive shortly. When combat breaks out in one of these zones roll 1d10. In that many rounds a group of Corp cops will arrive to kill or detain everyone on the scene with a weapon (see the appropriate Corporate Guards encounter). Likewise, when rolling for an encounter in the more lawless zones (Combat and Hot Threat Ratings) you may want to avoid using encounters from the lower end of the scale (Below 50) unless it’s a slow day in the zone. Combat is more likely and a peaceful resolution is harder to come by. The exception to these tables is the Executive Zone, which acts as a haven for high-level Corporates and their families. The Executive Zone is outside the City and locked off by the highest security money can buy. If your Players ever make it to the Executive Zone they won’t run into encounters and will instead have to deal with the constant, paranoid, surveillance of Corporate security. If you even draw a gun in the Executive Zone the Corp cops will be on you in seconds and they’ll arrive in greater numbers, with better weaponry.

S CREAMSHEETS In the world of Cyberpunk RED, screamsheets are custom-designed newspapers either printed on flimsy paper or downloaded to an Agent via the local Data Pool. Screamsheets are also what we call something that pair a page of in-world text (in the form of a Night City Today screamsheet) and a page or two of instructions for running a scenario during a game. These Screamsheets are simple to setup, easy to customize, and, with just a little work on the part of the Gamemaster, easily a full session's worth of adventure. If you're a Player, we highly recommend you don't advance to the next few pages. Skip to page 435, instead, and read Black Dog, a story about a group of Edgerunners who get a job that takes them from Night City to... well, we won't spoil the rest. If you're a GM, read on. Don't be afraid to change things up to move a scenario to a different city, tie one into the Lifepaths of your Edgerunners, add in your own NPCs, throw in some random encounters from the previous section, or just make things more interesting for you and your Players. Cyberpunk really is what you make it. 3:56 PM GOSSIP OPINION weather tech lifestyle local business world Biotechnica Researcher Found Alive by Jackie McGee Professor Kōgan Akigo, head of Biotechnica’s Project: Orchard and presumed dead was found alive last week in the northeast woods of the BosWash. His current condition is unknown. Professor Akigo was hailed as an innovator in agri- cultural genetic engineering after his work with 'super crops.' It was his research that helped launch 'Reference Forests’ in an attempt to repopulate diminished forests due to disease, harmful insect life, and pollution. Professor Akigo and his staff were presumed killed in a tragic dam break that wiped out a community only a half mile from the prototype 'Orchard.' The incident set Biotechnica back six months in launching other Orchards. When asked for comment, Biotechnica offered this: \"We are grateful to have Professor Akigo back with us. He’s currently recovering after his traumatic experience. He is looking forward to getting back in the labs once he is ready.\" Link: Famine Solved? Biotechnica Takes Lead Link: Secret Nuclear Waste Facility Destroyed in Dam Break Link: Kōgan Akigo Land Grab in Washington by Jericho Hunt A private group of investors has begun a massive land grab in the Free State of Washington. The target acquisitions: wood- lands. In the past few months, millions of acres have been purchased. Who is behind the buyouts remains to be seen, but this event isn’t without victims. Small communities have suffered due to the closing of woodland access, leaving the lumber industry with no place to harvest. The legal representative for the investors released this statement: \"The investors have big plans for this land, and they ask locals to please be patient. Work will be coming, and everyone is going to win\". Sadly, those are not comforting words for those who are suffering. It looks like this will be a wait and see. Reference Forests: Controversy? by Jackie McGee Biotechnica is no stranger to cutting edge genetic engineer- ing. Their 'super crops' and 'Orchards' are helping curb the food crisis across America. Organizations like the Food Investor’s Corp (FIC) have fully endorsed these endeavors. In the last year Biotechnica has revealed what they call 'Reference Forests' to help restore decimated forests and rebuild the lumber industry. With three of these forests already up and running, Biotechnica has been working to grow their operations. The yield from each Reference Forest is enough to rebuild small communities. However, not everyone is happy about the Reference Forests. Green Fist, an environmental activist group, has demanded that Biotechnica be shut down for harming Mother Nature. In a statement from Green Fist’s founder, \"Green Hammer,\" he explains that, \"These geneti- cally engineered trees are an abomination to the Earth. They destroy the ecosystems around them and don’t allow for natural selection. Not to mention that most of the trees grown are not native to the lands they’re grown on. It’s just one big cash-grab, man! We need to shut it down.\" Some scientists agree with the activist group, but most don’t. Professor Geri McKennel, lead arborist for Biotechnica had this to say: \"What we are doing here is rebuilding whole forests in a matter of a few short years. This is producing clean air and helping restore the natural order. These activists just don’t understand. Yes, we have some trees that aren’t native, but by growing them we may someday produce trees that will be able to grow in the most inhospitable places. We could even grow trees on Mars.\" The idea does sound amazing, but only time will tell if these Reference Forests are our friend or our end.

There’s no denying that the Queen of Solos is making a name for herself and her organization with her recent string of high-profile successes. 427 428 ▶ Player Information ◀ Biotechnica is looking for a team to stand guard over one of their Reference Forests in northern California. There has been a recent string of thefts from other sites and they believe that the next location to be hit will be Site RF003. The corporation isn’t looking to hire people that will do more damage than good. They want people who will be sensitive to the eco- system in the Reference Forest and leave a minimal footprint. Biotechnica will provide access to forest security drones, 1,000eb per person, and room and board while the team is there. Any team that accepts the job will receive this briefing from Professor Geri McKennel: \"As you are aware, in the last three months two of our Reference Forests have been hit by wood pirates. Whoever they are, they have cut down dozens of valuable trees and removed a few dozen burls. At first, we thought it was Green Fist, but it’s looking more like someone out there doesn’t want us cutting into their business ... no pun intended. These pirates have hit at night when the forests are unattended. Site RF003 is the next logical location for a hit. Your job is to go into the forest and set up an ambush. Find these pirates and find out who is funding them. As for dead or alive, Biotechnica doesn’t want to know what happens after you get the intelligence.\" The team is flown in via a VL-11 Corporate Bus (Helicopter) and dropped just outside of RF003 at a Biotechnica ranger station. The forest is dense and the trees tower over the surrounding region. It doesn’t even look like RF003 was established in the last decade. A Biotechnica rep is waiting for the team at the station. He will point out the value of the forest, rambling on about Dalbergia which isn’t even native to the region and how Biotechnica is able to acclimatize it to the region through genetic splicing. The forest is also densely populated with mahogany and oak. There is an access road that leads into the forest. The rep will give temporary access codes for the security drones (Use Mini Air Drones on pg. 213) to either a Netrunner or Tech. This will allow the team to control what they see and allow them to maneuver drones as needed. If there isn’t a Netrunner or Tech, he will only offer a link for agents that offers a standard video security feed instead. The rep also provides the team with an access key to a firewatch tower located at the heart of RF003. He men- tions that there is a decent supply of food inside along with hammocks. If there are any questions the rep will answer with vague responses and just point into the forest, wish everyone good luck and in a not-so friendly way emphasizes avoiding damage to the ecosystem. It’s about an hour hike to the firewatch tower and the site’s nothing to brag about. It’s constructed from fireproof materials and has a center lift, along with a ladder that goes to the top. In order to access the lift, the team will need to use the access key. The inside of the watchtower isn’t very high tech, but it does offer a 360° view of the forest. There’s a solar panel that provides basic power for meteorology computers and communications for the security monitors. There’s even a seismograph. The hammocks are not well made and won’t support the weight of anyone with more than one cyberlimb. There are two metal folding chairs next to the computer console. The food comes in the form of freeze-dried packets and there isn’t even a sink. Water must be carried up from a rain catch basin at the bottom of the tower. As for a toilet, there is an old wooden outhouse that smells like death. ▶ Gamemaster Notes ◀ The 'pirates' hitting RF003 are actually working for one of the Biotechnica investors out of the Free State of Washington. The idea is to drive Biotechnica to move all their operations out of NorCal and solely invest in the Free State of Washington instead. That would make millions for all the investors. There are two teams of pirates that will hit RF003. There are a number of pirates with chainsaws equal to half the number of Edgerunners and a number of pirates with SMGS equal to the half the number of Edgerunners. All of the pirates have Kevlar®. (Chainsaw Pirates: Use Road Gangers; Add Very Heavy Melee Weapon; Replace Leather with Kevlar®. SMG Pirates: Use Road Gangers; Add Heavy SMG and Heavy Pistol Ammo x50; Replace Leather with Kevlar®.) The first team will strike from the east while the other attacks from the northeast. The seismographs will go nuts because each team is driving large logging trucks. The trucks are unmarked and don’t have any forms of identification of ownership inside. With the seismographs going off it will give the Characters enough time to get close to where the trucks are going before the pirates can do too much damage. The drones will show the trucks going deep into RF003. The chainsaws are loud and will cover any approach by the Characters. The trick here is to nail each team before they do any damage. Unfortunately, at least one tree is going to get cut down. If the Characters don’t split up, the damage is going to be worse. The pirates aren’t there to fight either, but they also won’t let themselves just get taken. They will put up a serious fight to escape. If a pirate is captured and interrogated the prisoner’s head will explode right as he starts spilling the beans… Damn undetectable micro bombs. In the morning, the Biotechnica rep will show up to see how things went. If there was any damage to the forest, he’ll throw a fit. Total Pay is reduced by -100 eb per tree lost. He’s really not amused by the fact that they still don’t know who is hitting the Reference Forests but it’s a start. He’ll offer the team an extended contract to guard RF003. WOOD PIRATES 4:52 PM GOSSIP OPINION weather tech lifestyle local business world New Arms Race: Construction? by Ziggy ‘Front’ Page As Night City begins to rebuild, there’s a new arms race hitting the streets: Construction. The sight of Zhirafa equipment is ubiquitous throughout the city as would-be architects and design engineers are scooping up high paying contracts to help rebuild. It’s not just manpower either. Scientists have been jumping on the bandwagon. Petrochem has been working with companies to make better use of energy consumption from heavy construction machinery while Militech has been working on a new form of blast-proof material. Even Biotechnica has been participating with their 'Reference Forest' project. Of course, it’s not all flowers. This mad rush for innovation and materials has led to an increase in construction site sabotage and theft which could jeopardize the progress being made in the Rebuilding Center. Director Bon Chaney, of the Night City Restoration Committee, put it this way: \"Each theft, each delay, keep us from rebuilding residential blocks and helping get people back to some level of normalcy.\" With so many people displaced by the catastrophe and the amount of homeless occupying the suburbs, disease and famine are a serious concern. Director Chaney is calling for people to work together to rebuild, and points out there will be more than enough work for everyone. Will Night City have a new Golden Age? Only time will tell.

Link: Danger Girl 429 430 ▶ Player Information ◀ Taking to the streets usually offers some adventure, but today is special. The crew hits the asphalt looking for some action. As they hit their first local spot, they come across a Postal Service truck delivering a package to a shop on the corner. The truck is pretty tricked out with an Armored Chassis, Bulletproof Glass, and an Onboard Machine gun manned by a scrawny kid wearing a Flak vest and helmet that look about three sizes too big for him. The postal lady driving the truck is decked out in all black leathers and Kevlar®. Her Techhair is styled in a way that makes it look like she has cat ears. When she sees the crew, she’ll wave and say \"Hello,\" in her usually squeaky voice. When it comes to knowing what is going on across the city, the mail lady sees a lot. If asked if there’s anything fun hap- pening, she tells the crew about some work being done two blocks down close to a gangland border. She also points out that she doesn’t know why anyone would want to do work on the sidewalk there since the block usually gets shot up daily. After, she winks and struts back to the postal truck and speeds off, laying a rather large black strip. Sounds like it might be fun to check out what’s going on. It’s sure better than sitting around being bored. As the crew gets to about four blocks away, they can hear the sound of gunfire. It looks like there’s a party after all. At the one block mark the crew can see a large glass box sitting in the middle of the sidewalk. Inside there’s a pile of neatly stacked currency, a pistol, a rifle, and a teddy bear. Every few seconds someone runs up and tries to smash it, all while bullets ricochet all around them. The street and walk- ways are crowded with people, guns drawn, shooting at each other. Some of the people blazing away look like they might be gang connected, but there are about a dozen more that are just randomly shooting at the box or each other. An older man dressed in casual attire approaches the crew and tells them that he could crack into that glass case easily, but there are too many trigger-happy choombas by it. He offers to split the swag if the crew clears out the crowd. ▶ Gamemaster Notes ◀ Militech is getting ready to launch their new Maximum Security Safe and wanted to do a little marketing. They hired street marketing guru Willy Maze to work his magic promoting it. The claim to fame for this safe is that it’s inde- structible (100 HP). When it comes to guerrilla marketing, Willy is the man. Without permission from the city, Willy took the Maximum Security Safe to a part of Night City known for gang activity and secured it to the sidewalk with massive iron bolts. Public works is going to be pissed, even though they refuse to go to that block because of the gangs. While his street crew installed the safe, his Tech crew set up cameras all around to film the chaos. The safe was left concealed until about mid-morning when one of his team ran by and removed the covering. The safe is made from a transparent material, so the 5,000eb, along with a Militech Avenger (Excellent Quality Medium Pistol), a Militech Bulldog (Excellent Quality Shotgun), and a teddy bear holding an envelope are in full public view. Inside the envelope there is a private invite to a Militech job fair. There is a large decal on the safe that reads 'Maximum Security Safe.' In addition to mounted street cameras, there are drones flying around recording the entire show (Use Mini Air Drones). Any time a shot misses a Character roll 1d10. On a 7-10 the shot hits a camera drone instead. The two gangs involved are low level boostergangs. The first is a minor local gang called the Albino Alligators (5 total; Use Boosters stats). They’re all wearing T-Shirts with a car- toon-like white alligator carrying an Assault Rifle. Some have the logo tattooed on their upper arms. The second gang is the Piranhas (5 total; Use Booster stats). The remaining people on the street are a variety of locals (10 + 1d6). The GM can arm these bystanders as they desire. No one will attack the Characters unless they try to approach the safe or if they start shooting at people trying to get to the safe. If the Albino Alligators lose more than two members, they retreat. If the Piranhas lose three members, they retreat. Both gangs take their dead and wounded with them. The crowd will disperse after half of them are either incapacitated or wounded. Once the area is secured, an old man will emerge with a large cylinder on his back and a hose that runs down to a nozzle. He will turn the release on the nozzle and a whitish aerosol sprays onto one edge of the safe. It will take about two minutes to do one side. 1d6 streetrats (Use Booster stats) will make one more attempt to take the safe from the Characters. These attackers are easily scared and if one of them dies the rest will flee. When the old man finishes, he asks if he can borrow someone’s piece. He’ll take the gun and tap the side of the safe. While the glass-like material doesn’t break, the sealant used to hold it together gives way and all the glory falls to the ground. If more than half of the Characters are in the Seriously Wounded Wound State the old man then turns the gun on the them. Just goes to show you can’t even trust an old choomba. If not, he takes his share and leaves. SMASH THE BOX 5:12 PM GOSSIP OPINION weather tech lifestyle local business world Street Theaters Pop up in Suburbs by Ziggy ‘Front’ Page As the global economy struggles to balance out, imports and exports have suffered. This has made it more difficult for film companies to get their movies made. This was made worse by the crash of the Old NET. But a new trend is popping up around the suburbs of Night City: Street Theaters. Entertainers affiliated with Julliard Performers Guild have begun doing shows on street corners and it’s gaining in popularity. There’s no cost to attend the shows, but the performers do take dona- tions. In some cases, these thespians are bringing in almost 500eb a night. The more elaborate the production the more people come to watch. This has drawn in Techs looking to make a little eb on the side. Eric Wells, thespian, explained it this way: \"People are tired of spending hard earned creds on crappy reruns. They want real emotion and stories. The street theatre phenom is delivering just that.\" The downside to these street theaters is a slight increase in pick pocket thefts, but it’s not enough to deter people from attending.

Link: REO Meatwagon Call Button Ghost NET by Miller Marcus When Netwatch closed down access to the Old NET, many Netrunners refused to let it be. Their infiltration into the Old NET has yielded valuable data and several ‘ghost’ stories. There are tales of NET phantoms who became trapped in the system when it was closed and Netrunners who fell victim to R.A.B.I.D.s. The question then becomes, are these really ghosts or just data memory scans that exist in the NET but aren’t sentient? Artificial Intelligence experts like Professor Killgrave Shaw suggests that, \"In some sense these ‘ghosts’ are sentient because they feel the emotions that the Netrunner would have felt. This makes them living beings.\" Theologians like Reverend Phillip Longfellow argue that, \"The memory ghost has no soul; therefore it is not alive. Are we to say that AIs are now soulful entities like humans? Doubtful. A program is just that, a program. It does what it was programmed to do, nothing more.\" While it may sound cold, the Reverend has a valid point. Of course, it also means that instead of losing loved ones in the future we could just download their memo- ries and keep an AI version of them on our Agents. As for the ‘ghosts’ inside the Old NET, could they be retrieved or purged from the system? It’s a possibility, but one Netwatch refuses to comment on. With Data Pool access becoming more common around Night City, it’s possible that the Old NET could very well be dumped in lieu of a more local network system with global access linkage. Link: Specters of the NET Link: Netwatch Frustrated Over R.A.B.I.D.S. in Old NET Gang War Ends Early by Jackie McGee Ongoing tensions in the suburbs began to boil over this week leading to a gang war between The Primetime Players and the Piranhas. The shooting had only lasted one minute when guns on both sides proved to have one fatal flaw: they were 3D printed using very unreliable materials. Both gangs suf- fered massive casualties caused by these extremely cheaply printed guns exploding in user's hads.. Within 24 hours of the incident, a teen going by the name Zip Print was found hanging from a lamp post with a bullet hole in his head and \"cheap\" carved in his chest. Underneath him was a pile of broken guns that he had sold to both gangs. While the murder of the teen is tragic, both gangs have declared a cease fire until they could buy more reliable guns.

Link: Sanroo HelloCutie Good for 5eb off your next Hello Cutie Purchase 431 432 ▶ Player Information ◀ When it comes to cult classic weapons, no one designs them like JayeZK. Her spin-offs of Sanroo’s Hello Cutie line are everywhere. From the ShotFrog (Shotgun) to the Koi Kicker (Heavy Pistol), her creative endeavors have made a name for themselves. Anime fans can’t get enough. With fame also comes things like big lucrative contracts and unwanted attention from unscrupulous con artists. JayeZK has reached out to the crew because over the last week she’s been getting harassed by a rival 3D artist who goes by the name Gangster 3D. The guy has tried to break into her Agent, blackmail her with less than flattering pictures and vids, and generally shows up to every one of her outings looking for a fight. JayeZK has had enough. She asked the Characters to act as her protec- tion next week during a street art show where she’s presenting her new ideas to a rep from Sanroo. She offers a part of any commission that is offered by the company. ▶ Gamemaster Notes ◀ Gangster 3D (Use Netrunner) is a fake name, which becomes clear once Characters start digging for more infor- mation on the guy. If followed, he will lead the crew to the offices of DizCom, a fledgling design firm that specializes in peddling 3D print files. The DizCom office is located in a much larger building on the 20th floor. There’s an elevator designated for the public to access the offices. There are a number of security officers at the front desk equal to half the Players (Use Security Operative; Add Cyberaudio Suite and Radio Communicators) and a number equal to the Players patrolling the building. They’re all linked by an internal communications system. There is a private elevator and two sets of stairs, one on the north face and one on the east side, both with street access. The Ground Floor has a NET Architecture with an access point in the front desk and on the north face by the door. The exterior stair doors have cardkey locks which can be bypassed (Electronic/Security Tech DV10). The private elevator has a built-in defense system (Sleep Gas Elevator. See pg. 216). If the crew can access the private elevator, they find that it only has two buttons: Penthouse and Ground. Whoever this belongs to must have some serious creds. The 20th floor stair access has the same security system as the exterior stairs and there is another NET Architecture which can be accessed from the 20th floor landing. This NET Architecture has 2 Imps present in it which won't attack the Characters unless they enter the lower right branch (the one with the Control Nodes) of the Architecture. If there are only 2 Characters, there is only 1 Imp. If the crew fails to bypass the door’s security on the first try an alarm goes off (Electronic/Security Tech DV 12 to shut down). Alarms will summon the patrolling security guards who will promptly throw out the Characters unless they decide to shoot it out. If that happens, NCPD will show up in 2d6 turns (1d6 officers at first, Use Security Operative stats). When the Characters eventually get to the 20th floor, be it by regular elevator or back stairs, they come out onto a level that has nice white vinyl flooring and several holo-posters on the walls showing off various properties of DizCom (Buster Swine, Electric Bunny, Hyper-Active Hyena, Captain Piranha). As the Characters walk by the frames the figures will stop dancing and singing as they gaze at the visitors with scowling faces. They have completely gone from happy and joyful to down- right terrifying. The long hallway leads to an office door with the DizCom logo all in bright blue colors. It’s an automatic door, which opens when anyone gets within 2 meters. As the door glides open it will let out a series of giggles that sound like children. Inside there is a single desk and behind it a door. A woman is sitting there with an over-exaggerated smile (she flickers slightly). She welcomes the Characters and asks if they have an appointment. If anyone says no, she will ask if they’d like to make one. If the Characters lie, she looks confused for a moment and then suggests that the Characters are jokers. She then asks them to leave. If they refuse, skip ahead to the Cartoon Battle. Trying to set up an appointment is a hassle. The woman tells the Characters that there is a three-week waiting list. She doesn’t budge. If at any point things become hostile, a Cartoon Battle occurs: The outer doors to the office open. In the hallway the cartoon characters are literally coming out of the frames. Their eyes are glowing bright red. The secretary’s eyes are also glowing an angry red. The cartoon characters will start growling before opening fire on the Characters. The cartoon characters are actually holograms that surround drones (Use Large Air Drones with Very Heavy Pistols and Observation Cameras, see pg. 213). Anyone firing at the cartoon characters will notice that the bullets are going right through the bodies and hitting the wall further down. The drones hover inside the heads of the cartoons. After discov- ering this, the Crew can fire on the drones without having to aim for the head. There is 1 cartoon character and 1 Drone Control Node for every Player Character (Maximum 4). They are controlled by 2 Imps (see pg. 212) in the top floor's NET Architecture who each trigger two on their turn. After the drones are defeated the PCs can grill the secretary, who is a pseudo AI and won’t say anything. She can't stop anyone from entering the management office. The door has an electronic lock (Electronic/Security Tech DV 12). When the office door opens it reveals a bizarre scene: A man’s upper THE BIG BREAK 433 torso is plugged into a massive rig of tubes and wires. He has nothing below the ribcage. There are two drones hovering next to him with little robotic arms. The man, a Netrunner named Winston Frumighter, doesn’t want trouble and will confess to being behind the harassment of JayeZK. He reveals that he was trying to scare off the Sanroo rep and get the 3D artist for DizCom. Gangster 3D is just a paid face. Mr. Frumighter promises to leave JayeZK alone if the Players let him live. If the Players attack Mr. Frumighter, he will fight back (Use Netrunner; Reduce MOVE Statistic to 0). The two drones in his office have no weapons and do not attack. Later that day, JayeZK meets with the Sanroo reps, who decide not to use her. ▶ GRounD FlooR net ARChiteCtuRe Floor On the Other Side of the \"Door\" DV 1 Password 6 2 This Control Node controls the cardkey locks on the exterior doors. 6 3 This File contains the schedule of appointments for a Mr. Frumighter.

Sure, she can fill in the line with her own ideas, but that won't be his. It won't be what he would have said. And that's important. This might have been the last song ever. She needs to get it right. She owes him. a blind man lost, in the streets a pattern here, I need to see... Trace looks up from his Agent and the half dozen screens he's got linked to it. \"Ya know, that's about the two hundredth time you've sung that.\" He slides back in his chair and stares pensively out the sweeping glass window of the Conapt. \"And you keep changing the tune. Fucking annoying, you know.\" He gives the Rocker a mildly pissed off look before he relents. \"I know, yah. But I don't know the tune. I don't have enough to work from. One crappy pirate datalink from a crappy bunch of old recordings from a studio session that happened how many years ago?\" She looks up from her synth and glares at the Media, who shrugs. \"Your problem is obvious,\" he observes. \"Yah? You think?\" \"You need more brains on the problem. Put it out on the Data Pool. See if anyone bites back. Maybe there was somebody at the studio session that night— someone who's still alive and didn't dump the memory.\" Trace flips the screen view from the story he's been working on. He's not making much headway, anyway. Like Lilayah, he's only got fragments of the whole story, and the guy who told it to him—the Old Man—doesn't know the whole thing either. He taps the datacodes to open his personal Pool link to broadcast, holds his Agent up to face Lilayah. \"Repeat it. Again. As much as I'm fucking sick of hearing it, repeat it.\" And Lilayah does. It's hard to say who's more surprised when, twenty minutes later, there's a return ping on Trace's message link. The voice is a smooth contralto, with a slight metallic undertone. Female. Or vodered to sound that way. \"I saw your post. I think I can help you out.\" K epler and Pneumo In another part of Night City, Kepler is loading the upper mini-gun. It's been jamming too much, and she doesn't want it to crank up when she's on the Road away from a source of spares. She wipes her face with the back of her hand—the augmented one—and leaves a trail of cosmoline across her nose. She hears Pneumo chuckle from the corner of the Kombi where he sits when he's running the Data Pool. He's working on his pet project—a code frag he's been tracing for almost half a decade. \"Wha?\" \"Trace is posting some song Lilayah's working on. I think it's that thing she's been hammering on.\" His voice is rough: he doesn't use it much when he's in the Face. Kepler throws a rag at him, then turns back to the mini- gun. \"I don't know why the frack those two haven't hooked up yet,\" she says absently. The Netrunner flips up his goggles and begins to work through a stack of data-chips. He's looking for something good he can turn into fast euro to fund their next trip on the Road. \"Not everyone who works together has to hook up and get married, Kep,\" he replies, voice still thick with London drawl. \"You and me are kind of unusual around these parts.\" \"Yeah, but…\" Kepler pauses in mid conversation. She's spotted something. Multiple silhouettes moving through the trash piles towards the Kombi. \"Sorry. Busy, Nu.\" she grunts as she hoists herself into the saddle of the mini-gun. Good thing I just reloaded, 437 BLACK DOG she thinks as she triggers the IR in her left eye and links to the gun's processor. Her amped vision IDs the shapes as a group of boosters trying to flank the Kombi's position. Looks like the Iron Sights boys are back. She flips the safety off, swivels the gun, and cuts loose. The roar of the heavy mini-gun shakes the whole Kombi, knocking books off shelves and dishes across the kitchenette. Iron Sights gangers scatter, fall. Some drag their wounded out of her field of fire. She cuts the mini- gun—no sense in wasting ammo. Those guys aren't going to be coming back for a while. \"Hey, Kep.\" says Pneumo, unplugging his ears with his extended cyberdig- its. \"Trace just pinged me. Something interesting.\" Kepler grins. She was starting to get bored. D amien and Zara Damien's just finished replacing the pistons in the forearm when the ping comes. Fracking Russian cyberware, he thinks, turning and letting his drone crawl down his arm toward the Agent propped up on the workbench. The drone's mag clamp picks up the Agent and brings it back to him; he talks out of the side of his mouth as he struggles with the recalcitrant Russian arm. \"Go ahead,\" he says. He doesn't actually need to talk to the Agent—he's wired for full radio/audio—but customers appreciate the personal touch of seeing your face. He listens to Trace for a few minutes, then puts down the cyberarm and shuffles out to the workshop door. \"Yo, Zara!\" The Solo looks up from the target she's just been punching holes in. Not too many people practice archery these days, but she's always thought it was a useful skill: silent, well-ranged, and you almost always got your ammo back. \"What?\" she replies, slotting her optics back from targeting mode. \"We in trouble or something?\" Damien stands in the door of the ram- shackle metal container/office. \"Nah.\" he says with a grin. \"Just Trace and Lilayah. They want us to cover their high-priced butts while they check out one of Trace's story leads.\" Zara pushes in the retainers and the bow folds down into an easy to carry package. The arrows are also collapsible and she keeps them in a holster across her back. The bow isn't her only weapon: as a professional, she's also a crack shot with the Kang Tao she keeps in her shoulder holster. She shrugs. Trace is a reliable source of income, and he's a lot smarter than most of the clowns she gets as her principals. She's good with anything he comes up with. \"Let's roll,\" she says, picking up her go-bag and heading for her bike. S amantha \"So, like I said, I think I can help you,\" she says. \"She\" is named Samantha, and she's seven feet tall. Chromed from head to toe, she looks like a metal Amazon, down to the shaped metal muscles. Incongruously, she's wearing a tank top and warm leg- gings on a body that never feels pain or temperature unless she wants to. Full Body Conversion, thinks Damien. He's staring at her like a dog looking over a steak; not out of lust, but with the desire to get in there and dismantle her to see how she ticks. Her cool blue cyberoptics look him over, then through him, focusing on Lilayah. \"You're the Rockerboy?\" Samantha asks in that smooth contralto. Lilayah nods and Samantha gestures to a couple of overstuffed leather sofas around a central coffee table. \"Grab a seat,\" she offers. They do. meeT The crew The main Characters in Black Dog (Lilayah, Trace, Kepler, Pneumo, Damien, and Zara) were created with the help of six remark- able, real-life Cyberpunks we like to think of as \"The Cyber6\". Five of the Cyber6 rock real world prosthetic limbs and that's something we thought a lot about as we wrote Cyberpunk RED. Cyberpunk is closer than you think. Often, that idea's something to cause concern but when it comes to what has been accomplished in the world of prosthetic devices, that idea is one of joy and it was something we wanted to honor in this edition. The Cyber6 aren't inspi- rational because they've got prosthetic limbs and live full lives. They're inspi- rational because they, each and every one of them, are a bright, shining example of how to make the world a better place. That'd be true no matter what. We'll be introducing the Cyber6 , and the Characters they created, in the sidebars in this story. 438 BLACK DOG Trace's trained eyes scan the room. It's like a garage—no, it is a garage, except with a few pieces of overly comfy furniture set up in strategic spots; there's even a huge feather bed off to one side. But three things stand out in particular: One is a full-sized sports car parked in one of the vehicle bays—immaculately preserved for a vehicle two decades old. The second is a large framed holo of a Rockerboy—the legendary Johnny Silverhand, in an alcove surrounded by digital candles and assorted concert memorabilia. The last thing is a large wooden crate. It's about eight feet long, four feet wide. It's bound with metal straps and has several sophisticated lock and defense devices bolted to it. Samantha sits down gracefully. Everything she does appears to be graceful. As they join her, she reaches into her silvery cleavage; there's a soft pop and a small panel opens between her breasts. She extracts a slim plastic wafer: a datachip. She holds it up in front of Lilayah. \"What you have is just a fragment,\" Samantha explains. \"Someone was there that night after the club was closed; they grabbed a sample before the bouncers thew them out. But what I have,\" and here she gestures with the slim blue chip, \"is the complete song, recorded in his own voice. Johnny Silverhand.\" There's something in her voice; something that pen- etrates even through the perfectly vodered tones: a sense of awe. Both Trace and Kepler's eyes meet as they catch it. She's a Silverhand fangirl, they think at the same instant. She's been saving this chip like a memento all these years. Samantha continues. \"But before I give you this, I should tell you a couple things: The chip was recorded by Johnny just before his disappearance in 2023. But it's been damaged by—well, it's been damaged by an EMP blast.\" Damien scans the chip with his eyes cranked to maximum magnification. After a few seconds, he says, \"Radiation, right?\" Samantha looks surprised. \"How did you know?\" The Tech shrugs. \"After the Nuke, there were tons of blasted chips and other electronics around town. I'm a Tech, right? I get people all the time bringing EMP damaged chips to me. I've gotten to know the signs.\" Samantha sits back thoughtfully. \"Well, okay then. The whole song is there—I think. But part of it is garbled; like an encryption. I'm no Tech, I couldn't recover that part; I just made a copy of the original. This is one of those copies.\" Her eyes close as though she's remembering something painful. \"You can have it though,\" she finally says. Trace watches Samantha's face as she hands Lilayah the chip. Finally, he says, \"So what do you want in exchange?\" Samantha looks surprised, then BY ADRIAN MARC 439 BLACK DOG resigned as the Media says, \"This is Night City, choomba. In this City, nobody gives anyone anything without a price. So, name it.\" The silver woman slowly nods. \"Okay, just one thing. But it's kind of a big thing.\" She gestures to the large wooden crate nearby and says, \" I need you to deliver that to another place. A city. In New Mexico. To a place called Los Alamos Labs.\" C ity BATTLE They’re dragging the Crate towards the Kombi. Samantha is with them, but toward the back. The gang drops in all around them. They drop the Crate and a firefight ensues. In the staccato din of autofire weapons and the boom of the heavier guns, Kepler runs towards the Kombi, with Zara and Pneumo covering her back. Pneumo tosses a dazzler bomb at their pursuers. Reaching the driver's side, Kepler opens the cargo hatch in the Kombi's back. Meanwhile, Samantha has manhandled the Crate up onto her shoulders. She stag- gers towards the Kombi just as the cargo hatch drops, slamming onto the street. She tells Zara to dump her bike out the back—she'll take care of it. Pneumo pushes the bike out onto the street and Samantha almost throws the Crate into the cargo bay before stagger- ing back. \"It's in!! Now get out of here!\" she yells at the full deafening volume of her voder. Damien yells to Samantha: \"You fireproof?\" \"Be a pretty stupid firefighter if I wasn't!\" she retorts, her over-stressed ventilation system wheezing. \"Groovy,\" he yells, then opens up with a long tank/hose unit he's pulled out of the back of the Kombi. A huge gout of fire streams out into the middle of the gangers. Napalm. Kepler guns the Kombi, blasts right through the fire and over the debris toward the road, pausing only to let Trace and Lilayah clamber aboard through the open doors. They hurtle through the wreckage of the glowing Hot Zone, pursued by several road warrior vehicles packed with gangers. By now, everyone is shooting back at their pursuers. As they pass access points, Pneumo takes control of various cranes and other build- ing machines, including a pair of huge GRAF3 construction mecha, which he uses to knock over one of the scaffolds surrounding a half-constructed building. The scaffold crushes one of the pursuing punknaughts, but the rest keep chasing. Suddenly Kepler slams a hard right and tears down between a row of stacked cargo containers. Gangers still glued to her trail, she slams through a security fence and into a large open area framed by hundreds of containers. From all angles, leather clad Nomads rush out with weapons. They recognize the Kombi as one of theirs, and turn their fire on the gangers, who run from the fusillade of Nomad fire. Kepler slams on the brakes, kills the motor. She slumps back in the seat as a large Nomad with an immense handlebar mustache and a rakish Stetson cruises up to the driver's window. He's car- rying a smoking M249 SAW. He smiles and says in a friendly drawl, \"Little Lady, if you're planning to join up with the rest of this Convoy, you're cutting it a mite fine I'd say.\" N omad High Road \"Good thing the Kombi was big enough,\" comments Pneumo with four of them now crammed into the passenger com- partment. The Kombi is twenty-nine feet Kepler's family, a Florida Nomad Pack, was always scrambling to make ends meet. She was born missing the lower half of her right arm but due to her family's lack of money she wasn't able to get fitted with cyber until she ran off on her own to earn the ebs. These days she usually teams up with her husband, Pneumo. Ashley Sherman was born in Chuluota FL, just outside of Orlando. Like Kepler, she was born missing the lower half of her right arm just below the elbow. Growing up, she lived on a farm riding and training horses, dancing, and scuba diving. Her first prosthetic arm was a gold i-Limb Quantum bionic arm by Össur. Today she lives in London pursuing her career in modeling and acting with her husband, James Young, and their child. KePLer created w/ the help of Ashley Sherman 440 BLACK DOG long, shaped like a heavily armored, smooth sided box. It can sleep eight, ten in a pinch. It's a standard design used by Nomad families all over the Southwest: bathroom, kitchen, and storage spaces are crammed throughout its capacious roadframe. The Kombi is her home—the last thing Kepler ever got from her family in Florida. It’s blinding midday, heat shimmers rising off the line of endless asphalt headed East. Around them are dozens of vehicles: low slung cyberbikes, armed and armored ground cars of all makes and models, assorted Kombis similar to their own, and towards the middle the gigantic looming shapes of the Roadhaulers—the big, multi-jointed Nomad ground truck- trains that can carry tons of cargo con- tainers as well as space for at least half a dozen families each. \"We're lucky they let us in,\" comments Pneumo with a grin. Kepler shakes her head. \"Not lucky, babe. It's thanks to Trace. The Aldecaldos are like, well, fucking Nomad royalty.\" She props her feet up against him—Pneumo is driving and she's taking the opportunity to rest her shoulders after her midnight helldrive. She adds: \"You don't turn down the son of Old Man Aldecaldo if you still want a place in the Families.\" A clink inter- rupts her explanation: Damien is tinkering with some upgrade to the Kombi's engine he plans to install when they camp down for the evening. Over the rush of highway noise, she can also hear Lilayah's synth pinging as the Rocker tries to pin down the song she keeps working on. a blind man lost, in the streets a pattern here, I need to see keep returning keep trying to leave got a bad feeling that I need to feel black dog runs at my side... Running down the main storage bay of the Kombi, taking up the space that would normally hold Zara's bike, is the Crate. It's surprisingly heavy. It's also surprisingly well protected. Samantha has warned them in no uncertain terms not to open the Crate. \"Open it and you'll be signing your own death warrants,\" she says. \"Even I can't open the thing. Just haul it out to New Mexico, to the address I've down- loaded to your Agents, and it's done.\" She's also given them several thousand eb for expenses, but that's not the point. In Night City, if you promise someone you'll do something, you just do it. In the back of the Kombi Zara sits, staring at her hands pensively. She finally reaches into her go-bag and pulls out a large wrapped package. It stinks of cos- moline, and as she unwraps it, she can see that the big gun has seen a lot of use, but it’s been well taken care of all the same. As she was heading out of the garage, Samantha took her aside and pressed the package on her. \"You should take this,\" the silver woman said. \"He's not ever going to use it again, and I think you're the right person to carry it for him.\" Like Samantha, the huge automatic is silver chromed. Zara lifts it, sights down the barrel. It seems very heavy. Heavy with some ineffable quality that's more than its weight. She thinks she knows what it is, but she’s afraid to find out. G HOST STORIES Evening in the desert. While the rest of the group are gath- ering for food, Trace wanders over to the middle of the Nomad camp. He asks a few questions, then some more, until eventually, guided by the information he's gathered, he draws up to the fire next to a thin, long haired man roughly around forty. The Nomad raises a metal flask companionably at him. \"You drink, young Aldecaldo?\" Pneumo learned justice from his parents: honest cops in a corrupt system. He started Netrunning early to fight the powers that be and that eventually led to a chase and an acci- dent that almost killed him. His family smuggled him out of the country, where he was rebuilt and met his wife and partner, Kepler. A presenter on the BBC, double-amputee James Young is a passionate science communicator who earned the nickname \"Metal Gear Man\" after working with Japanese video game company Konami to design his own unique bionic arm. James' work, including \"Can Robots Love Us?\" can be seen on the BBC Three YouTube channel. He lives in London with his wife, Ashley Sherman, and their child. Pneumo created w/ the help of James Young 441 BLACK DOG \"You know me?\" responds Trace, raising the flask and taking a swig. The Nomad nods. \"I haven't seen you in a spell, but lessee ... you were about seventeen last time. I had a lot less grey in my hair then.\" \"You knew my old man, right?\" \"Yes, I did.\" \"Mind if I ask you about something? The Nomad chuckles. \"Fire away, young Aldecaldo.\" \"So, the Old Man told me a bit about the Arasaka thing. About the Bomb, the fight.\" Trace looks at the Nomad specu- latively. \"He said you were there.\" His companion nods, takes back the flask, and draws a swig. \"Long time ago, that.\" Trace just looks at him, then to the fire, then back to the Nomad again. \"When you're young, choomba, you think you're immortal.\" The older Nomad reaches out, stirs the dying fire. Then he looks back at Trace. \"So Old Man Santiago never told you what went down that day?\" \"He told me some of it. But even he didn't know the end.\" \"Well, that's because he wasn't there. He'd moved on a bit from his days chasing around with Rogue and Johnny. Met your ma, settled down, ended up taking over the leadership of the Family. But me, I was there to the bitter end. Was a lot younger then, of course, about your age in fact. I was one of El Lobos—the Wolves—the warriors of the Aldecaldos. Wore a lot of leather and carried a long rifle; made a bit of a name for myself in fact. \"So … lessee. We dropped out of the AV on the top floor. Shaitan covered the entry and Spider Murphy was hacking the cyberspace defenses. Johnny, I don't know why he was there. Maybe he was feeling bad about not having rescued his compañera after all those years. Anyway, he was there, with his big silver arm and his big silver gun. And we went in, all the way down to where the Ara's had their Lab—where they were keepin' Silverhand's lady friend. Ten floors down into the building. \"Then they jumped us. They got the reporter guy in the first attack. We Lobos were pinned down; I lost my brother Antonio that day. Then that big bastardo, the Smasher, he came rolling in like la tormenta. Would have killed all of us, but then Silverhand stands up and yells some- thing at him and starts shooting. He had to know it wasn't going to do any good— even that big silver gun wasn't going to stop the Smasher, but he tried and got torn up for his trouble. But it gave Shaitan a chance to get a grip on the Smasher and hold him while we grabbed the reporter and piled for the elevator to the top. We had to leave the Rocker behind; we just ran out of time. \"Here's what I still don't get. We were carrying a suitcase. They didn't tell me what it was, but it was pretty heavy. And during the fight, I looked around for that Morgan guy, the head cabrón, but he was nowhere in sight. He just took off with the suitcase and I think he headed down the stairwell. I didn't see him until we were lifting off in the extraction AV, when he and that bastardo Smasher went at each other. \"About a minute or two later, as we were pretty far away from the building, that Nuke went off.\" Trace's eyes narrow. This is what he's been looking for. T HUNDER ON THE ROAD Early in the morning. Dawn. On the road. Kepler stays to the middle of the convoy, toward the back. After several hours, dry When your dad is the boss of an entire Nomad Nation, it can be hard to make your mark. Trace Santiago's doing that as a Media. He worked \"legit\" for a while but went solo after getting passed over for less \"ethnic\" reporters multiple times. Now he uploads his own reports directly to the Data Pool. Trace Wilson is a children's author, bionics ambas- sador, and congenital amputee. Born without a right hand, Trace grew up with anxiety about being different. He published his first children's book at the age of 21, the same year he received his first bionic arm. The book, \"Uniquely M e\" and i t s s equel, \"Uniquely Brave\" help kids with disabilities learn to love the differences that make them unique and overcome their anxieties. Trace sanTiaGo created w/ the help of Trace Wilson 442 BLACK DOG desert scrub hurtling by endlessly, they spot some- thing, A dust cloud rising in the back, way back in the heat haze. Trace pulls out his drone and deploys it. It streaks rearward, relaying its imagery back to the waiting Media. After a few minutes he grunts, \"We got trouble coming. Bike gang.\" But not the normal \"road warrior\" type bikers. These guys are anything but the typical gogang. It's nearly fifty bosozoku bikers—the dreaded Japanese bikers, heavily armed. These guys are elite. They have really good bikes armed with serious weapons: machine guns, grenade launchers, rockets. They’re also really good looking—Japanese idol singer good looking.. Lilayah is aghast. \"We're gonna get killed by a fucking boy band?\" she yells over to Zara. Up to now, Zara hasn't jacked into the Gun. But this is a bad situation, no time to get warmed up on a new weapon. She pulls the link cable out of the butt of the big silver automatic, jacks it into her wrist. After a moment, her eyes blur; the targeting reticule with all of its accessory heads up displays overlay her vision. \"I'd rather die.\" yells the Solo back as she aims, fires, aims again in a ceaseless rhythm. Damien cuts in. \"Was that guy wearing makeup?\" Zara shakes her head. \"Not well.\" Lilayah snorts. \"If you wanna call it that.\" The bosozoku unfurl tall black flags from their rear fenders and move in at high speed. Kepler guns it, putting the Kombi further into the middle of the convoy. Then the horde of bikes are on all of them. Engines howling, the pack of bikers flank the convoy. The convoy opens up: weapons from Kombis and Roadhaulers hammering, spewing shell casings all over the road behind them. Nomad gyrocopters sweep down from the sky, sweeping the horde with light autofire. But the bikes are hard to hit. They weave in and out of the convoy, looking for something, probing, until they eventually spot the team's Kombi.BY SEBASTIAN SZMYD 443 BLACK DOG While Kepler weaves in and out of the tightly packed mob of vehicles, trying to shake their pursuers, Pneumo mans the top turret, sweeping heavy .50 cal machine gun fire downrange while struggling to avoid hitting any other members of the convoy. Meanwhile, Zara and Lilayah lean out of the armored Kombi windows and start tagging targets as they move into range. A biker tries to cut in front of Kepler, aiming to block her. Kepler revs the Kombi and rolls over him. Another biker runs up the open ramp of a nearby Roadhauler and goes airborne, leaping over the Kombi and trying to drop a grenade on Pneumo. Without thinking, Zara snapshoots the grenade out of the air—the Gun's interface seems to boost her situational awareness to absurd levels. It almost seems to take her over, giving her a seemingly super- natural accuracy and a palpably cold eagerness. Later, Damien will determine that the Gun's cyber interface has been modified to create almost cyberpsycho levels of feedback, damping down the user’s normal emotional reaction to combat situations, and giving them a robot-like control. But there's no time for that now. She keeps firing. Two bikers swing out to the driver's side, opening fire on Kepler's rear quarter. Damien pops up from one of the gun ports and dumps a combination of napalm and fire onto the road. The Kombi on the other side swerves and sprays the leading biker with autofire; the bike skids and almost crashes into Kepler, who yanks the wheel to the right to avoid the bullet spray. She slams into the biker flanking them on the passenger side, who spins out into his partner. They outpace the explosion as the Roadhauler runs down both fallen bikes. The big Roadhaulers start dropping spike mats, disrupting the tight phalanx of the bosozoku. Then, there's a sound of jet engines getting louder, louder. With an ear shattering sound of thunder, three Nomad AV-4's drop in over the dry foot- hills, their red-eye directed mini guns ham- mering a high-pitched song of death. The big side doors roll back, revealing gimbal mounted .50 cals that sweep doom from all sides. The bosozoku try to rally, but the sheer volume of fire breaks their ranks. Protected by their hovering AV escorts, the convoy powers on towards the relative safety of distant Albuquerque. H OT POTATO The Convoy has pulled over in the tiny, deserted ghost town of Grants New Mexico. There used to be a Walmart in Grants—its doors have since been busted out and the entire building has been well looted. But the immense parking lot is still there, covered in drifting sand in some places, and the Convoy is using it to take time to lick its wounds and reload its weapons. Overhead, the AVs orbit, watching the road in either direction. But down in the Kombi, there's a new fight in progress. \"Okay. What the hell is going on?\" shouts Lilayah, sounding—well, pissed isn't half of it. Zara rubs her head angrily. \"Yah. What's so important that someone's willing to send a whole fracking army of mercenary bikers after us? Guys like that aren't cheap. That's Corporate level shit.\" Pneumo shrugs. \"Are you sure we were the target?\" Trace shakes his head. \"I had the drone out, watching. The bikers swept the whole convoy, then zeroed in on us. There's no doubt we were who they were looking for.\" \"Look, no one was trying to kill us before we took this job. Well, no one who wasn't usually trying to kills us.\" Lilayah gestures at the Crate. \"And they didn't attack us on the way in—only on the way out.\" Always fascinated with technology, when circum- stances forced Damien to get a cyberarm at a young age, he wasn't upset. It was just one more toy to play with. Grown up now, he prefers work as a merc Tech instead of a Corp drone to earn the eb he needs to build what he sees in his mind's eye. For as long as Brian Marquez can remember, he's been passionate about video games. Using that passion, he worked his way into a producer role in the industry and now fights to not only make games fun but playable by everyone. Having been born with one arm, he's always wanted to make sure he could play the games he loved and he's made a career out of making sure everyone else can, too. damien created w/ the help of Brian Marquez 444 BLACK DOG \"After we picked up the Crate,\" says Kepler. \"Yeah...\" says Zara. \"The Crate...\" Everyone stares at everyone else. No one wants to ask the next question. Finally, Trace looks over at Damien. \"So ... you been snooping around like I suspect you've been?\" Damien looks a bit abashed. He spreads his hands. \"Only external scans,\" he confesses. \"And...?\" Trace prods. \"Umm. Yeah,\" says Damien. \"Okay. It's using a lot of stored power. Pretty radio- active at one end. Won't kill us, but I'd say make sure your rad filters were working all the same.\" \"You want me to try and hack the pro- tective systems?\" offers Pneumo. Kepler shakes her head in the negative. \"I keep thinking about what the nice silver señorita said,\" says Trace. \"The part about signing our own death war- rants particularly stands out to my mind.\" Zara grimaces. \"Yeah, but someone's already tried to kill us twice to get this. That's what I call a pretty big hint.\" Pneumo laughs. Kepler folds her arms and glares at Pneumo. \"I'm against this. There's a world of hurt in that crate, and I want nothing to do with opening it. We agreed to deliver it, and that's all we should do.\" \"On the other hand, if we're going to die,\" retorts Lilayah, \"I'd really like to know what we're gonna be dying for.\" \"Hell. I already know what's in there,\" Trace asserts. The rest of the group stares at him expectantly. He shakes his head. \"It's Johnny Silverhand.\" They stare at him as though he's just announced he's a space lizard from Planet X, and he raises a hand before the arguments start. \"Look, it makes sense. I ran a search on our patron. She used to be a pararescue before the war. Firefighter. First into the wreckage when the Nuke went off. Already had history with Silverhand when she saved him from a studio fire back in 2015. And she's a Silverhand fangirl. Maybe a Silverhand groupie even—I hear he got around a lot and wasn't particularly picky. \"So Silverhand vanished right after the Nuke. No one's seen him since. Word on The Street was Johnny was working a big job with some of his old mates—a hit on Arasaka. You put the clues together and it's obvious: silver fan-girly found Johnny's body and put it on ice. And now we're moving it.\" \"I've got past the ICE,\" announces Pneumo suddenly. He's not one to wait around for the committee to decide. He looks over at Damien. \"Your turn,\" he says. The Tech hunkers down, working with his tools until there's a distinct click. Meanwhile, Kepler watches them both, furious. Damien and Pneumo stand back, removing the blocky protective locks as they do so. Then they punch the access switch. There's a dull chuff as the seals on the crate release. Damien slides back the top as Zara stands ready to open fire with the big silver automatic. The rest of the group peers over the lip of the Crate. Packed tightly into the protective foam padding is an eight-foot-long, four-foot- wide, hi-vis grey cylinder, shaped like a torpedo. It's covered in numbers, letters, and many, many words in Japanese. Angry words. Largest, in the center, is a huge, yellow and black radioactive warning trefoil. Everyone stands silent for a long, long time. Finally Trace clears his throat. \"Well, I guess I'm fucked,\" he says. Known for her discretion, Zara worked as a body- guard for the criminal and wealthy and made good money doing it. When her identity got flashed onto the Data Pool by an enemy, she had to go underground to ensure she survived long enough to get revenge. Now, she's a hired gun for a group of Edgerunners. An actress, model, and disability representation in the media advocate, Angel Giuffria was born missing her left arm below the elbow. The youngest person in the world to be fitted with a myoelectric prosthesis, Angel stays on the cutting edge of bionic technology because she believes it is important for users to be involved in the process. She can be seen in \"Impulse\" and \"Chicago Med\" and has a Masters Degree in Psychology. zara created w/ the help of Angel Giuffria 445 BLACK DOG T HE BROKEN WHEEL They all stare at the Crate and its deadly contents for a long while. Then: \"I'm gonna have to tell the Trailmaster,\" says Kepler. \"They'll need to know.\" She sounds flat, almost defeated. \"But why?\" asks Lilayah, looking up from the ominous orange shape in the Crate. Confusion is all over her face. \"Because of the Law of the Broken Wheel,\" replies Kepler. There are blank faces all around, save Trace's. He nods his head slowly. \"The Law of the Broken Wheel,\" he repeats. \"Back even before the Bad Old Days, the people who built the nukes wanted to make sure that even a thousand years later, their descendants would know not to mess with the stashes and stockpiles of atomic weapons—old reactors—nuclear waste. So, they spread the idea of the \"Broken Wheel\": a simple iconography that even a post-holocaust culture could remember. The atomic trefoil—it's the Broken Wheel. Every Nomad kid learns about it. It's one of our most important bits of culture. Nomads run into old atomics all the time—the Law of the Broken Wheel is that when you find something with that symbol, you get out of there fast. And you leave it alone.\" \"It is forbidden to travel on the Broken Wheel,\" intones Kepler solemnly, like a small child reciting a catechism. \"Convoys, scavengers, even pirate Families avoid it like the plague. You're not allowed to keep anything marked by the Wheel, and no Family will carry it. It's an absolute taboo.\" She stands up, spreads her hands, face determined. \"You wanna come with me, Trace? Just in...\" He also stands. \"I helped you lug it in. Guess I'll take the hit with you. Only fair, choomba.\" They both rise and climb out of the Kombi, moving to the head of the mass of parked vehicles. ... \"Looks like Trace's connections weren't enough to keep us in the Convoy after all,\" mutters Pneumo. \"Shut up,\" grates Kepler. \"I'm still royally pissed at you,\" she adds as she powers the Kombi down a dusty highway. The Trailmaster kicked them out at Albuquerque. The rest of the Convoy is still headed east on US 40 to Oklahoma City, but their group is now traveling north of Santa Fe on a dusty, potholed road framed by dismal and lonely signs for Highway 84 North. It's a ghost road; probably no one's come up here since the start of the War. Shifting sands cover parts of it, punctuated by cracked, overheated asphalt. They've covered a fair distance by the time they hear the sound of jet engines. Over the hill sweeps what Night City inhabitants call a panzer: a light fan tank with Chobham armor and a large 30mm cannon. It's way out of their league. And now it's blocking the highway. \"Well,\" grunts Trace. \"Guess it's time to saddle up or die.\" \"Hey, so yeah, they have a tank. Big deal,\" says Damien. \"We've got a nuke.\" \"Not funny,\" snaps Lilayah, slamming a clip into her Minami 10. \"They won't shoot at us,\" asserts Pneumo. \"The whole point is to get the Bomb. We're secondary.\" Kepler looks back at him momentarily. \"Maybe we should just surrender, Nu.\" Like a lot of Rockerboys, Lilayah calls Seattle home. Or she did, before she moved to Night City. She sticks to her roots, though, and plays a style she likes to think of as cybergrunge. Lilayah also does jobs with her Edgerunner friends. After all, she won't change the world just by making music vids. As Mike Pondsmith was working on this stor y, he realized he needed a Rockerboy to bring it together. That's why he asked Amelia Kołat, a friend whose posts influence hundreds of thousands of people daily, to help him make Lilayah. The grunge was entirely her idea. She's a big fan of it as well as of WoW. Amelia lives in Poland with her gorgeous cat. LiLayah created w/ the help of Amelia Kołat 446 BLACK DOG But Trace shakes his head. \"We're witnesses. They aren't going to want to leave anyone alive. Not if these guys are who I think they are.\" \"So we're screwed, blued, and tattooed,\" says Zara. She lifts the Gun, pulls out the interface cable and plugs in. \"Might as well get ready for that Last Stand then...\" They're starting to take up positions when the panzer explodes. Two attack AV-9s spiral out of the sun, mini-guns driving a hailstorm of death before them. The rem- nants of the panzer, victim of the lead AV-9's antitank missiles, is still a blazing inferno, its ammo cooking off as the second AV-9 settles down to earth in a swirl of jet engines and kicked up dust, right across their path. The cockpit of the AV slides back. Flanked by an imposing pair of heavily armored guards, a small female figure climbs to the ground. She's dressed in black armor, but instead of a helmet she sports a cheerful pink beret. She waves to the dumbfounded group in the Kombi. \"Hi there!\" she calls in a clear, girlish voice. \"I'm Michiko! I'm here to rescue you!\" M Y BROTHER’S KEEPER \"I owe you an explanation,\" Michiko begins as she sits down on the open Crate, treating its contents as though a multi-kiloton atomic weapon was everyday to her. \"I’ve been following you for some time, but I first had to deal with a ... problem back in Night City that delayed me.\" There's a pregnant pause which seems to imply that someone, somewhere (or maybe even a large number of someones) are no longer among the ranks of the living. \"You're Michiko Arasaka, right?\" avers Trace. His brow furrows, and Michiko smiles. \"I really haven't gone by that name since I married, but yes, I am Michiko Arasaka.\" She looks down at the orange cylinder she's sitting on and adds, \"I suppose technically this bomb is mine, too.\" She laughs a twinkly little laugh that from anyone else would seem like something out of an anime, but from her seems singularly appropriate. \"You see,\" she continues in a quiet, purposeful voice, \"as soon as an atomic weapon was detonated in the Towers, my father sent people in to examine the ruins. When they found that the weapon was actually a Militech device, they were both relieved and concerned. Relieved because this meant Arasaka wasn't the cause of so much death and destruction. But concerned because what only a few people in the Company knew was that Arasaka had also planted its own weapon in the Towers—a much more powerful one—in the event that Militech was able to overrun the Headquarters and take possession of the secrets inside.\" \"My father's men were especially concerned because when they searched for our bomb—the Arasaka weapon—it was missing. They determined that only a very strong person, or a full body con- version, could have moved it. So they used radiation scanners to track the trail and eventually found that the device had been hidden in the basement of a nearby garage. Owned by a firefighter paramedic named Samantha Stevens. \"Unfortunately, my father ... passed away... He died before he could give the location team further instruc- tions. So the decision was made to just leave the bomb where it was, but to keep a watch on the garage and the firefighter unless it was moved. And it stayed in the garage for fifteen years. Until now.\" \"So, you had your own bomb?\" presses Trace. But before Michiko can respond, Pneumo leans over, waving his Agent in front of her. \"And these are the trigger codes, aren't they?\" he says, his cool British tones laden with amusement. Michiko's eyes scan the Agent screen, and widen. \"These could very well be them,\" she confesses. \"It is one of my father's command codes.\" She looks up, and the large brown eyes narrow. \"How did you get these?\" she asks, the girlish voice shifting to a sharp staccato of practiced command. Pneumo's grin is triumphant. \"I've been trying to track down what these went to for the past five years. I pulled them out of a system that was later tracked to a drifting yacht. As it happens, a yacht owned by your late father.\" He and Michiko exchange smiles like friendly sharks, interrupted only when Kepler cuts in with a dry: \"And he's been a regular pain about it too.\" She smacks Pneumo on the head with one hand, but not too hard. 447 BLACK DOG \"And that's why they've been tailing us,\" says Zara flatly. \"Arasaka wants to make sure their nuke never makes the headlines.\" \"No, they want to make sure who ever does have it doesn't set it off,\" counters Pneumo. \"I'm sure I'm not the only one who has the det codes by now. I know there were others looking, much as I tried to cover my tracks. In my case, I really didn't know what the codes went to. I just wanted the answers. But you can bet the other hunters do know, especially if they also worked for Arasaka.\" \"—And someone wanted this thing to be taken off the market before the other guys could find it,\" Damien cuts in, and his expression turns grim. \"Los Alamos was a famous nuclear facility. Back before the Collapse even. Stands to reason if there's any place you could get a nuke dismantled safely, it would be there.\" \"I have renounced the name of Arasaka,\" says Michiko, her small voice still hard and flat. \"But I have not renounced the responsibility of that name. Far from it. And there are factions in the Company that would use this weapon for their own ends. Some would use it to discredit what little good will Arasaka has rebuilt after the War. Some would use it as a threat to make Arasaka more powerful—able to blackmail cities; even governments. It was because I had to deal with those people first that I was delayed from coming to your aid sooner. And for that, I am truly sorry.\" Michiko stands up, her girlish demeanor instantly gone as though a switch has been flipped. \"I am the heir of Kei Arasaka,\" she continues. \"No matter what I feel about my legacy. So, I will act and help you take this demon's tool to a place where it can be properly disposed of.\" She looks up at the group around her. \"Will you agree?\" Damien chuckles. \"We can be on the side with the big ass gunships or we can go up against the big ass gunships. Sounds like an easy choice to me.\" He raises an eyebrow, cyberoptic glinting in the harsh light. \"Anyone think different?\" There are various nods of assent. The die is cast. J UST CALL ME ANGEL IN THE MORNING The rest of the trip is uneventful as the black AVs hover overhead protectively. About midday, they peel off to the North. Michiko radios a cheery \"Good luck!\" And then, they reach the front gates. Los Alamos Labs is huge, covering an infinity of acreage. Most of it is falling apart. No one's been here in a decade as far as Kepler can tell as she threads through the maze of rusting security gates and warning signs. Over her shoulder, Trace is reading Samantha's directions from his Agent, while Pneumo tries to pick up any kind of NET system still active in the endless ghost town. \"There,\" gestures Trace at last, pointing to the left. Kepler makes the turn and comes to a stop in an outside lot filled with assorted derelict ground cars. \"This is Building PF-4?\" says Damien in disbelief. \"This is the 'heart of America's nuclear deterrent'?\" He snorts. The Plutonium lab is a nondescript, two-story brown building in a clutter of nondescript buildings. If it wasn't so huge, you wouldn't even notice it. \"Is it safe to get out?\" asks Lilayah. Damien shrugs. \"We've all got enough anti-rad drugs in our system to pretty much stop anything short of a gamma burst. But the counter reads low back- ground—that thing in the Crate is probably emitting more heat than what's outside.\" Zara climbs out of the Kombi, the big silver gun drawn. Then she freezes. A half dozen security cams are watching them. There's a tinny hum as two roof- mounted autoguns track in line with the cams. Frack. Then a woman's voice comes out of hidden speak- ers: \"I'll bet Sammy gave you that.\" Zara nods slowly, holding it up. The voice continues, \"Hang tight; I'll be right down.\" A long, long minute passes before one of the heavy shielded roll-up doors finally opens and a blonde woman in a battered work clothes emerges. She waves, and walks over to them. \"Hey, you're the guys Sammy sent? Welcome to the Lab. I'm Angel.\" She offers Zara a slim, well-callused hand. \"Glad to see you made it.\" 448 BLACK DOG The blonde woman is tall and almost ethereally beautiful, but in a way that seems to reflect a life of hardship and pain. A large tech's toolbelt hangs loosely around her waist. As the rest of the group climbs out of the Kombi, weapons at the ready, she grins and walks over. \"Rough trip?\" Pneumo shrugs. \"Been better. You our drop-off?\" Angel nods. \"Mind if I check it out before deliv- ery?\" Kepler punches the ramp button and the back of the Kombi whines open to reveal the loading bay. Angel walks over to the Crate and looks into it. \"Looks like a bomb to me,\" she says finally, then slaps her hands together in a business-like way. \"Well, let's roll it inside,\" she adds briskly. \"so I can get the thing disarmed.\" Trace raises an eyebrow. \"You're going to disarm it?\" Angel nods. \"Can't think of a better place to disarm a lost atomic warhead than a place that makes them.\" She whistles one short tone, and from the depths of the huge building a large powered transport cart emerges. Damien nods to himself. Of course they'd use robotics here, he thinks. Place is probably too dangerous for most non-shielded people. The cart rolls to a stop between them and Kepler maneuvers the Kombi's lift gate to slide the Crate onto it. It sags under the weight. Angel gives a satisfied nod. \"I'll have to thank Sammy for finding you. This thing has been on her mind since the day she found it. You've taken a real load off her shoulders.\" She turns back; raises a hand, exposing a thin blue plastic sliver—a cash chip. \"You did a great job, and I want to thank you too.\" Angel hands the chip over to Kepler, whose eyes widen as she reads the amount on its display. \"Sonova—\" \"You earned it,\" says Angel. \"Go buy yourselves another Kombi or something.\" She whistles at the cart, and it starts trundling back to the roll up door with the Crate aboard. Then she stops. \"That's right,\" she says suddenly. \"Sam told me you met because your Rocker was looking for something?\" \"Samantha gave me this data chip,\" says Lilayah. Angel nods. She pulls out a second chip—this one is a match for the one in Lilayah's hand—and flips it to the startled Rocker. \"Here,\" she says. \"This is a full recording of the song you wanted. Made from the original studio session.\"BY PEDRAM MOHAMMADI 449 BLACK DOG Lilayah, protesting, says, \"But how did you...?\" And as Angel reaches the door she looks back and chuck- les. Then says with a lilt in her voice: \"Sammy isn't the only Johnny Silverhand fangirl out there, you know.\" And then she and the Crate are gone into the bowels of the huge brown building of PF-4. There's a pause. Finally, Trace says, \"So, now that we're filthy rich, wanna see if we can buy a drink somewhere?\" \"Frack that,\" replies Zara. \"Remember that place we passed outside of San Pueblo?\" She drops the big silver gun into the holster at her back and smiles. \"I think we should go back there and buy the whole fracking bar.\" ... \"I'm dying,\" says Samantha over the comlink. \"All the dose I took when I moved the bomb has finally hit my spinal cord. Cancer.\" \"You shouldn't have done it, Sammy,\" says Angel. \"Or waited till I could have sent help.\" But Samantha shakes her head. \"We didn't know who or what owned the thing. And the rad detectors were going off all over the place from the last one. If I hadn't been full-body—if I hadn't been a rad-shielded firefighter—I would have been dead within the hour. As it was, I had enough time to clear all the important stuff out of that wrecked bunker. And to get rid of the hot stuff at the bottom of the Bay.\" \"And I thank you for doing that,\" Angel replies. Then adds, sadly, \"Are you sure I can't do anything to help?\" Samantha shakes her head. \"I promised I would get him to you in the end. Took me a while to find the right people—people I could trust—but they did the job. Now my bit is over. \" She sighs, breathes heavily as if blowing hair—hair that hasn't been there in three decades—out of the way. \"Gonna go get me a glass of good rye whiskey, sit back on the couch, and when I feel it's about time, I'll hit the kill switch and shut down my life support.\" Carefully, Angel rolls the heavy bomb casing over. She punches a code into the small keypad now exposed. There's a hissing of compressed air, of utter cold that blows back her hair, as the casing splits to reveal the blue-white ice of the hidden cryo-chamber. She looks tenderly down at the dark, frozen face behind its masking curtain of ice. \"Hello, my love.\" she says. ▶ Black Dog ◀ a blind man lost, in the streets a pattern here, I need to see keep

The Megacorporations spent decades wrecking everything and in the aftermath of their last War, everyone has to fend for themselves. But that’s just fine. You can handle it. After all, in a world of vicious boostergangs, rampaging cyborgs, corporate assassins, and nihilistic doomsday cults, there’s only one rule: Always take it to the Edge. Take the big risks, get the big rewards. Be the action, start the rebellion, light the fire. Never drive slow when you can blaze a trail. You’ve hooked your Militech pistol to the interface in your brain; upgraded your cybernetic fist with carbo-glas blades; and installed cybereyes that can pierce through the red haze like morning fog. There’s a world full of opportunities out there, just waiting for the right Edgerunner. Maybe that’s you. Cyberpunk RED is the latest edition of the classic tabletop roleplay- ing game of the Dark Future and encompasses everything you need to explore the post-War world of the Time of the Red, including: • A dense, deep-dive into the history and geography of Night City and the greater Cyberpunk world, and plenty of the lore about the Time of the Red. • Ten unique Roles for you to play: charismatic Rockerboys, lethal Solos, quick-hacking Netrunners, inventive Techs, lifesaving (and taking) Medtechs, hard-hitting Medias, duty-bound Lawmen, scheming Execs, clever Fixers, and range-riding Nomads. • A huge collection of useful tools, powerful weapons, protective armor, and gleaming cyberware to help you rule the Street. • Three Screamsheet adventures to show you what Cyberpunk is all about. • Pregenerated opponents perfect for populating the Combat Zones and Corporate compounds, plus encounters that use them to bring the City to life.","libVersion":"0.3.2","langs":""}
