Creating personas help understand users’ needs, experiences, behaviours and goals. • Creating personas can often help designers and developers to step out of themselves and reduce ego-centric biases or assumptions. • Personas are usually created on the basis of user research. • Personas are distinct and memorable. Example A page or shorter with • Name • Photo/sketch • Narrative – Relevant features of life, goals and behaviours Why are Personas Important • Aid communication between designers/ developments by providing a shared points of reference • ”How does this design decision impact persona: XYZ” • “How does this design decision impact this group of users” • Communication is important for: • Helping with planning • Creating a single point of reference (e.g., shared definition) • Highlighting problems earlier in the development process • Ensure development efforts are streamlined • An abstract idea can constantly change in a discussion/argument with a college – a concrete design artifact can not Designing Personas A number of ways to think about this: • Goal Directed – For well developed concepts, values and goals may be defined in advance Designing Personas A number of ways to think about this: • Goal Directed – For well developed concepts, values and goals may be defined in advance • Role Based – Data driven, take into account behaviour and organisational factors Designing Personas A number of ways to think about this: • Goal Directed – For well developed concepts, values and goals may be defined in advance • Role Based – Data driven, take into account behaviour and organisational factors • The Engaging Perspective – help create empathy and involvement in social interactions cases Designing Personas A number of ways to think about this: • Goal Directed – For well developed concepts, values and goals may be defined in advance • Role Based – Data driven, take into account behaviour and organisational factors • The Engaging Perspective – help create empathy and involvement in social interactions cases • The Fiction Based Perspective – based on teams understanding often unrealistic used as a starting point Designing Personas A number of ways to think about this: • Goal Directed – For well developed concepts, values and goals may be defined in advance • Role Based – Data driven, take into account behaviour and organisational factors • The Engaging Perspective – help create empathy and involvement in social interactions cases • The Fiction Based Perspective – based on teams understanding often unrealistic used as a starting point • Others • Quantitative data driven • User archetypes • Marking • Possible more? Designing Personas • Engaging – A well-rounded personas design to elicit empathy • Fictional - Developed without any data (so can be deeply flawed) • Bad Actor – Who intentionally tries to break everything or misuse the system Designing PersonasDesigning Personas: Data Driven Designing Personas Basic steps for designing personas: • Step 1: Find the users – Study lots of users to start getting a sense of who they are • Step 2: Identify relevant context and list users' attributes • Step 3: Group users with similar attributes • Step 4: Find patterns to form groups • Step 5: Construct personas – one representing each different group; avoid stereotypes There is a need to revisit personas over time as they can change with time Downside of Using Personas • Personas are abstract – it is hard to understand the abstraction process from user data to persona. • Personas are impersonal – the personifying details in personas fail to provide a sense of empathy. • Personifying details may mislead – it is difficult to select personal details that do not create false constraints on the design problem. • Personifying details distract – personifying details make it hard to focus on the aspects of a persona that are critical for the design problem.

CHI 2012 User Scenarios • Scenarios are narratives that explore an interface from the user’s point of view. • Using personas, • identify users’ common tasks • the context where interaction will occur • Identify users’ goals and the steps needed to achieve the goal • Scenarios can cover both common and uncommon usages. User Scenarios We use scenarios and personas generally to: • Identify users’ goals and the steps needed to achieve the goal • Identify steps to be completed by the user and the system User Scenarios Uses • Software development • Prescriptive to evocative User Scenarios • Uses • Software development • Prescriptive to evocative • Normally focused on actors who have one or more roles • Scenarios normally built from personas Scenario vs. Storyboard • Scenario is a narrative and may have limited or no visual aids • A storyboard provides visual narrative that focuses on capturing context… Creating Scenarios – Scenario 1Creating Scenarios – Scenario 2Example of Scenario Example of Scenario Example of Scenario Conclusion of Personas and Scenarios A user personas is a representation of the goals and behaviours of a hypothesis user type (group of users/ potential users) Often (but not always) personas are derived from data collected through some investigative means (e.g., surveys/ interviews/ etc) which we will cover later in this course. Scenarios useful for UX design and to help understand and create empathy for users to find the best solution and also help figure out where usability testing and understand key tasks in a product. Questions? Comments? Concerns? Persona Task: 1. Individually, create a persona that represents your personal approach as a student. • Choose one of the persona templates provided to communicate your learning style, motivations, and goals. • You can use the template as is, mix and match between the templates, or add your own sections - the format is flexible and can be changed or adapted as needed. • Complete a single page persona and post it you your User Interaction groups channel on Teams for group discussion. 2. As a group, discuss the personas, identifying common features and key differences. • Based on your discussion, develop an ‘archetype’ persona that represents the different types of students in your group more generally. • You may use one of the templates provided, or develop your own format based on the personas developed by your group. 3. Each group should post their archetype persona to the ‘General’ User Interaction channel on Teams. • Take a look at the personas posted by other groups and feel free to leave some constructive criticism. Do these personas represent you, as a student?
