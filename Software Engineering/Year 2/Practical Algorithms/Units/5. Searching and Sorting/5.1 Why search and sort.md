Let's talk a bit about why we are devoting most of an entire unit to the problems of **searching** and **sorting**. Three reasons that we can quickly mention (probably a few more out there):

1. Sorting is a widely used algorithm in many real-world applications.

2. Searching and sorting algorithms are useful for exploring more general concepts like algorithmic design patterns and algorithmic complexity.

3. And now a somewhat more pragmatic reason: as a CS graduate, you will simply be _expected_ to know these algorithms! They are an important component in the programming world lingo, so you just can't afford to not know them :)
