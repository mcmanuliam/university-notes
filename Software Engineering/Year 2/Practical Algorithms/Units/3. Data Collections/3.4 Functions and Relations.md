A function f from *A* to *B*, denoted *f: A -> B* is an assignment of each element *a* of *A* to exactly one element *b* of *B*

$$f:A -> B$$
- *A is called the domain of f*
- *B is called the codomain of f*

![[Pasted image 20241106101403.png]]

- If *f(a) = b*, 
- then *b* is called the *image of **a** under **f***.
- *a* is called the *preimage of b*.

#### Representations of Functions

- An explicit enumeration of the assignment
	- Table, list, etc.
	- Students-grades example

- A formula 
	- E.g.: *f(x)* *= x+1*
- A plot
- A computer program
	- E.g.: A Python program that, given an integer *n*, produces the *n*-th Fibonacci Number

#### Examples

- f(a) = **z**
- the image of d is **z**
- the domain of f is **A**
- the codomain of f is **B**
- the preimage of y is **b**
- the image of f : f(A) = **{y,z}**
- the preimage(s) of z is **{a,c,d}**

#### Injective Functions (All Outputs Are different)
A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is called injective, or "one-to-one", if it maps different elements of 𝐴 to different elements of 𝐵

That is, 𝑓 is injective if, for all 𝑥, 𝑦 ∈ 𝐴:

$$𝑥 ≠ 𝑦 ⟹ 𝑓 (𝑥) ≠ 𝑓(𝑦)$$

**Equivalently**: $$𝑓 𝑥 = 𝑓 𝑦 ⟹ 𝑥 = 𝑦$$
![[Pasted image 20241106102819.png]]
#### Surjective Functions (All Outputs Are covered)
A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is called **surjective**, or "onto", if it "covers" entirely its codomain. That is, if 

$$𝑓(A) = 𝐵$$

**Equivalently**: for every 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵 there exists an 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 such that 𝑓(a) = 𝑏.

![[Pasted image 20241106102948.png]]


#### Quick Quiz - Injections/Surjections
Let 𝐴 = 𝑎, 𝑏, 𝑐, 𝑑 , 𝐵 = 1,2,3 , and 𝑓 = {(𝑎, 3), (𝑏, 2), (𝑐, 1), (𝑑, 3)}.  

Is 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 injective or surjective?

**Surjective** since it's one to many.

#### Bijections (Perfect Match - Dashing White Sargent)

A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is called a bijection, or "on-to-one correspondence", if it is both an injective and a surjective. 

**Equivalently**: (every element of the codomain) `- surjection` has a (unique preimage) `- injection`


#### Comparing Cardinalities
If 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 is injective, then |𝐴| ≤ |𝐵| 
-  since each element of 𝐴 has a different image in 𝐵

![[Pasted image 20241106103535.png]]

If 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 is surjective, then |𝐵| ≤ |𝐴
- since each element of 𝐵 has a preimage in 𝐴

![[Pasted image 20241106103548.png]]

If 𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵 is bijection, then |𝐴| = |𝐵|
-  i.e. the sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 have exactly the same size

![[Pasted image 20241106103601.png]]

Hmmm… 
- If you can show that there exists a bijection between two sets, you can prove they are of the same size
- (Even if they are both "infinite"!)

$$𝑓: 𝐴➝𝐵$$
$$f(n) = n^2$$
$$A=\{0, 1, 2, 3…\} = \infty$$
$$A=\{0, 2, 4, 6…\} = \infty$$
#### Inverse Functions
A function 𝑓: 𝐴 → 𝐵 is invertible, if and only if it is a bijection. Then, its inverse function, denoted by 𝑓−1: 𝐵 → 𝐴, is the function defined by:
$$𝑓^{-1} (𝑏) = 𝑎 ⟺ 𝑓(𝑎) = 𝑏$$
![[Pasted image 20241106104112.png]]
Notice: 𝑓−1(𝑓(𝑎)) = 𝑎 and 𝑓(𝑓−1(𝑏)) = 𝑏 for all 𝑎 ∈ 𝐴 and 𝑏 ∈ 𝐵

![[Pasted image 20241106104137.png]]

#### Composition of Functions
**Definition:** Let function 𝑓: 𝐵 → 𝐶, 𝑔: 𝐴 → 𝐵. The composition of 𝑓 with 𝑔, is the function 𝑓 ∘ 𝑔: 𝐴 → 𝐶 defined by:

$$(𝑓 ∘ 𝑔) (𝑎) = 𝑓(𝑔(𝑎))$$

![[Pasted image 20241106104457.png]]

Example:
- g(x) maps students to percentage marks
- f(x) maps percentage marks to letter grades
- so (𝑓 ∘ 𝑔)(𝑥) maps students to letter grade

#### Relations
**Binary Relations - Definition**
***Seems like this is just assigning a variable to a relation between sets, All functions are just relations between inputs and outputs.***

- Let 𝐴, 𝐵 be sets. A binary relation 𝑅 is a subset 𝑅 ⊆ 𝐴 × 𝐵.
- If (𝑎, 𝑏) ∈ 𝑅 we say that "𝑎 is related to 𝑏 (by 𝑅)". 
- Notation: 𝑎𝑅𝑏

**Example**
- **Two Sets**: Suppose we have two sets, A and B. For example:

    - A={1,2,3}
    - B={x,y}

- **Pairs of Elements**: We consider all possible pairs (a,b) where a comes from A and bbb comes from B. The set of all such pairs is called the **Cartesian product** A×B, which looks like this: $$A×B=\{(1,x),(1,y),(2,x),(2,y),(3,x),(3,y)\}$$
- **Subset of Pairs (Relation)**: A binary relation R is just a **subset** of A×B. This means we pick some pairs from A×B that satisfy a particular condition or relationship.
    - For example, let's say our relation R contains only the pairs where the element from A is even. Then: $$R={(2,x),(2,y)}$$
    - If a pair (a,b) is in R, we say "a is related to b by R," or we write it as a bRa,

- Students: Alex, Bea, Cath, Don, Eddie, Fiona
- Subjects: 1CSF, 1CSP, AF2

- Let 𝑅 be the relation of students who passed the subjects: 
$$𝑅=\{(Alex,1CSF),(Alex,AF2),(Bea,AF2),(Cath,AF2),(Cath,1CSF), (Don,AF2),(Don,1CSF),(Fiona,1CSF),(Eddie,1CSF),(Fiona,1CSP)\}$$

Notice this is not a function e.g. Alex related to 1CSF and AF2 Relations are a generalization functions

So, injective, surjective, and bijective functions. Not very helpful names, right?

You could work with the less pretentious versions of their names: *one-to-one*, *onto*, and *one-to-one* *correspondence*. 

Maybe just keep images in front of you to remind you what these are:

![[Pasted image 20241106110027.png]]

So:

**1)** Are the following functions injections, surjections and/or bijections?

**1a)** f: Z -> Z where Z is the set of integers and f(x)=x^2
	**None**

**1b)** g: N→N where N is the set of natural numbers and f(x)=x^2
	**Injective**
	
**1c)** h: Z→2Z  where 2Z  denotes the even integers and f(x)=2x
	**Surjective Correspondence**

_(Hint:   
+ Try to think of cases that invalidate the condition for a function being injective. E.g., can you find a case where two different input values of x give the same output from the function? If you can, it's not injective. Otherwise, it is.  
_+ _Then, try to think of cases that invalidate the conditionsfor a function being surjective. Are there values in the co-domain set which could never be the output of the function? If so, the function is not surjective. Otherwise it is.  
__+ If a function is both injective and surjective, then it's bijective as well. Otherwise not. Easy peasy…

Quick review of inverse functions, and function composition:

![[Pasted image 20241106110950.png]]

For a function to be invertible, it must be a *one-to-one correspondence (bijective).* This means that every member of the input set (domain) must map to a unique element of the output function (co-domain), and that every element of the output set must be an output (image) of some element of the input set. This is the only way you can have an inverse function, where the output set becomes the input set.  
  

**2)** Let f be the function from {a,b,c} to {1,2,3} such that f(a)=2, f(b)=3, and f(c) = 1. Is f invertible and if so what is its inverse?
**Yes**
$$f^{-1}(2)=a$$
$$f^{-1}(3)=b$$
$$f^{-1}(1)=c$$

**3)** Let f: Z→Z  be such that f(x)=x+1. Is f invertible, and if so, what is its inverse?
**Yes**
***Only if it's positive numbers, negatives would break shiz***
$$f^{-1}(x)=x-1$$

**4)** Let  f: R→R such that  f(x)=x^2. Is f invertible, and if so, what is its inverse?
**No**

**5a)** If f(x)=x^2 and g(x)=2x+1, then what is f(g(x)?
$$f(g(x)) = (2x+1)^2$$
```python
def f(x: int):
	return x^2

def g(x: int):
	return 2 * x + 1

val = f(g(2))

print(val)
```

**5b)** If f(x)=x^2 and g(x)=2x+1, then what is g(f(x))?
$$ g(f(x)) = 2x^2 + 1 $$
**6)** Let f and g be functions from the set of integers to the set of integers defined by  f(x)=2x+3 and g(x)=3x+2.  What is the composition of *f* with *g*, and also the composition of *g* with *f*?
$$f(g(x))=6x+7$$
$$g(f(x))=6x+11$$
**7)**
![[Pasted image 20241106114328.png]]

**7a)** C -> A
**7b)** {(10, a), (7, b), (2, c)}

| C   | B   |
| --- | --- |
| 7   | b   |
| 7   | b   |
| 10  | a   |
| 10  | a   |

**8)**   Which of the following relations is *not* a function.  

R1={(a,1), (b,1), (c,1), (d,2)}
R2={(a,1), (b,1), (c,1), (a,2)}
