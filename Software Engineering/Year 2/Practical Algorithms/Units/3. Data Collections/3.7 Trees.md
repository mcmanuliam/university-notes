## Why Trees?

- Many times, the nature of data itself gives rise to a tree structure:

	- Family Trees
	- Classification of Items
	- File Structures
	- Data structures

## Basic Terminology

- Node - Singular item
- Edge - Break off points with a leaf
- Root - Start of tree
- Path - Line between nodes
- Children - Nodes linking from another one
- Parent - Nodes linking to another one
- Sibling - Nodes with the same parent
- Subtree - Trees inside larger trees
- Leaf Node - End of a trees path
- Level  - Essentially just drawing lines between each level and counting
- Height - Longest path from root to leaf

## Rooted Trees: a Definition
A (rooted) tree is given by:

- a set of nodes V, and
- A set of directed edges $E \subseteq V x V$ that connect pairs of nodes,

Such that:
- One node is the rooted
- Every node has one parent
- There's a unique path to every node

**Binary Trees can only have 2 children***

## Trees as Recursive Data Structures

- Each child of a node is the root of another "sub-tree".
- This naturally allows for recursive operations.

# Binary Trees

- A binary tree is a linked data structure in which each node has an attribute key and three pointer attributes
	- `node.p` points to its parent
	- `node.left` / `node.right` points to it's children

# Balanced Trees

- A balanced binary tree is a binary tree i which the left and right subtrees, of every node, differ in height by no more than 1.

	- ***Imagine a binary tree would have two children and those two children have two children, thus maintaining symmetry.***

- A balanced tree of *n* nodes, has height `O(log n)`
- An unbalanced tree has height `O(n)`
	- It can look like a linked list

# Traversal of a Trees

- A binary tree traversal (or walk) is a process of going through every node in a tree.

- Various types
	- ***Breadth-first*** traversals
		- Check the first levels
	- ***Depth-first*** traversals
		- In order traversal
		- Straight down
		- **Pre Order** - As soon touch the node, you print it
		- **In Order** - When you see the node from below
		- **Post Order** - When you see the node from the left

## The Algorithm

- All three algorithms are recursive:
	- They repeatedly make calls to themselves
	- Giving sub-trees as input

```typescript
interface Node {
	key: string;
	left: Node | null;
	right: Node | null;
}

function preorder(node: Node) {
	if (node === null) {
		return;
	}

	console.log(node.key)
	preorder(node.left)
	preorder(node.right)
}

function inorder(node: Node) {
	if (node === null) {
		return;
	}
		
	inorder(node.left)
	console.log(node.key)
	inorder(node.right)
}

function postorder(node: Node) {
	if (node === null) {
		return;
	}
		
	postorder(node.left)
	postorder(node.right)
	console.log(node.key)
}

function search(node: Node, k: string): Node {
	if (node === null || k === node.key) {
		return node;
	}
	
	if (k < node.key) {
		return search(node.left, k)
	}

	return search(node.right, k)
}


const node: Node = {
	key: 'A',
	left: {
		key: 'B',
		left: {
			key: 'D',
			left: {
				key: 'E',
				left: null,
				right: null
			}, 
			right: {
				key: 'F',
				left: null,
				right: null
			} 
		},
		right: null
	},
	right: {
		key: 'C',
		left: {
			key: 'G',
			left: null,
			right: null
		},
		right: null 
	}
};

console.log()
console.log("preorder")
preorder(node)
console.log()
console.log("inorder")
inorder(node)
console.log()
console.log("postorder")
postorder(node)
console.log()
console.log("search")
console.log(JSON.stringify(search(node, 'C'))
```

## Binary Search Trees

- A BST is a binary tree in which every node v satisfies the following property:
	- All nodes in the left subtree of V have keys smaller or equal than v.key
	- All nodes in the right subtree of v have keys larger or equal then v.key

## Searching
Search for a node with a given key.

- Given a pointer to the root of the tree node and a value k, return a pointer to a node with key k if one exists, return NIL otherwise.

Definition
- Start with searching at the root node
- Terminating condition: find a node with key = k, or reach unsuccessfully the leaves.
- if k < node.key, continue the search in the left subtree of node.key
- Otherwise go right.

***KISS def: If  current node smaller than left go left else go right.***

## Insertion
Insert a new `inode` into an appropriate pos in BT Trees
- The BST property must be preserved.

Definition

```typescript

interface Node {
	key: string;
	left: Node | null;
	right: Node | null;
}

function search(node: Node, k: string): Node {
	if (node === null || k === node.key) {
		return node;
	}
	
	if (k < node.key) {
		return search(node.left, k)
	}

	return search(node.right, k)
}


/* Just left this here as a function calling itself isn't that natural */
function iterativeSearch(node: Node, k: string): Node {
	while True:
		if (node === null || k === node.key) {
			return node;
		}
	
		if (k < node.key) {
			node = node.left
		} else {
			node = node.right
		}
}

function insert(tree: Tree, insertNode: string): void {
	parentNode = null
	currentNode = tree.root

	while (currentNode !== null) {
		parentNode = currentNode
	
		if (insertNode.key < currentNode.key) {
			currentNode = currentNode.left
		} else {
			currentNode = currentNode.right
		}

		insertNode.parent = parentNode

		if (parentNode === null) {
			Tree.root = insertNode
		} else if (insertNode.key < parentNode.key) {
			parentNode.left = insertNode
		} else {
			parentNode.right = insertNode
		}
	}
}

```
