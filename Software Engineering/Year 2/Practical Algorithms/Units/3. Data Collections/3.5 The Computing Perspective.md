So, let's take a step back. In this Unit, we are essentially concerned with *data collections*. 

We started by taking the mathematical view, which brought us to **Sets**, and then its very closely related concept, **Functions**. Those are the theoretical foundations upon which the computing perspective is then built. Almost any concept you engage with in the world of computing and software engineering has a mathematical underpinning, even if we don't always make that connection explicit when using them. 

We will now take a **computing view of  sets/data collections**. We will start by quickly revisiting some of the *data structures* we encountered in an earlier unit, just to remind ourselves that this computing view to data collections is not entirely new to us. But now, we also introduce a new twist to this story: the distinction between **static data structures** and **dynamic data structures**.  
  
With some fancy data structures under our belt now, we will climb up the abstraction ladder, and discuss ***abstract data types** (ADT)*, a bit of a mouthful, but really a rather simple concept: abstract data types simply focus on the **interface to a data collection**, without specifying the exact *data structure* that *implements it*. In other words, abstract data types focus on the WHAT, and abstracts away (basically, ignores), the HOW*.   
  
*The WHY is something that we are not concerned with this in course. When you sit down to write a program using data structures and algorithms, you should already know why you are doing it :)*   

We will look at a number of different abstract data types, revisiting *sets* too, after having thrown away the mathematical goggles and put on the computing ones.
