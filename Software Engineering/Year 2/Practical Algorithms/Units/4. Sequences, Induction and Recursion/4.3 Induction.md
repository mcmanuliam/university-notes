Climbing an Infinite Ladder, Can we reach ANY step in this infinite ladder?

Suppose we have an infinite ladder, and we can show: 
1. We can reach the first step of the ladder.
2. If we can reach a particular step of the ladder, then we can reach the next step.

***or, equivalently, any arbitrary rung of the ladder***

# Principle of Mathematical Induction

To prove that 𝑃(𝑛) is true for all positive integers 𝑛, we complete these steps: 
- Basis Step: Show that 𝑃(1) is true. 
- Inductive Step:
	- First assume: 𝑃(𝑘) is true for an arbitrary 𝑘 (inductive hypothesis) 
	- Then show: If 𝑃(𝑘) is true, then 𝑃(𝑘 + 1) is true for all positive integers 𝑘. 
		- That is, show: 𝑃(𝑘) → 𝑃(𝑘 + 1) ∀ 𝑘. 
		- (Using the if-then, or implication symbol "→", and for all operator "∀")

***Where "P" is a what is called a proposition.*** 

***A proposition is a statement that must have a truth value; that is, it must be either true or false.*** 

***P(n) is that proposition with a variable that has been set to the value "n".***

***Where k it's really a random number relative to the sequence.***

## Example

### Proof by Induction for $\sum_{i=1}^n I = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$

**Basis Step**:  
Verify the formula for $(n = 1)$:  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^1 i = 1, \quad \text{and the formula gives: } \frac{1(1+1)}{2} = 1.
$$
Since both sides are equal, the basis step holds.

**Inductive Hypothesis**:  
Assume the formula holds for \( n = k \):  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^k i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2}.
$$

**Inductive Step**:  
Prove the formula for \( n = k+1 \):  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \left( \sum_{i=1}^k i \right) + (k+1).
$$
Using the inductive hypothesis:  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} + (k+1).
$$ 
Simplify by factoring \( (k+1) \):  
$$
\sum_{i=1}^{k+1} i = \frac{(k+1)(k+2)}{2}.
$$
This matches the formula for \( n = k+1 \).

**Conclusion**:  
By induction, the formula is true for all positive integers \( n \).


## How to Write the Proof: Template
state clearly what you want to prove, i.e. **P(n)**

basis step
- show that P(1) is true [or, in general, P(b)]

Inductive step: 
- state clearly P(k), i.e. what you are assuming ( the inductive hypothesis) and possible values of k 
- state clearly P(k+1), i.e. what you want to prove
- then show P(k+1) is true using the inductive hypothesis, i.e. P(k) 
- in many cases this involves show that the $lhs = rhs$ of some equation 
- in such cases start manipulating the $lhs$ keeping an eye on rhs $as$ this is where you want to end up look out for where you can use the inductive hypothesis so you can use it

1) Prove by induction the Theorem that the sum of the first n positive integers is 

$$\frac{n*(n+1)}2$$

*(This was covered in the recorded lecture. Try to do this again from scratch without referring to the lecture/slides)*

**BASIS STEP**
$$n_1=\frac{1+1}2=1$$

**INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS**

$$1 + 2 + 3 + … + k = \frac{n*(n+1)}2$$

**We want to prove:**

$$1 + 2 + 3 + … + k + k+1=\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}2$$
**RHS**=$\frac{k*(k+1)}2$
**LHS**=$\frac{k(k+1)}2 + k + 1$
**LHS**=$\frac{k^2+2k+2}2$
**LHS**=$\frac{(k+1)(k+2)}2$




2)  Using mathematical induction, prove that the sum of the first n odd numbers is equal to $n^2$. That is, show that: $1+3+5+⋯+(2n-1)=n^2$

**BASIS STEP**
$$1 = 1^2$$

**INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS**

$$1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n-1) = n^2$$
**We want to prove:**

$$1 + 3 + 5 + … + (2n-1) + (2(k+1) - 1) = (k+1)^2$$

**RHS**=$(k+1)^2$
**LHS**=$k^2 + 2k + 1$
**LHS**=$(k+1)^2$

3) Prove by induction the Theorem that:  For any for any n∈ℤ+ we have n3-n is divisible by 3.  
  
4) Using mathematical induction, prove that the sum of first n even positive integers is n(n+1). That is, show that:  2+4+6+⋯+2n = n(n+1)
# Template
Using mathematical induction, prove that the sum of first n even positive integers is $n(n+1)$. That is, show that:  $2+4+6+⋯+2n = n(n+1)$.

**BASIS STEP**
$$n_{1}=1(1+1) = n_1=1$$

**INDUCTIVE HYPOTHESIS: 

$$2 + 4 + 6 + … + 2k = n(n+1)$$

**We want to prove:**

$$2 + 4 + 6 + … + 2k + 2(k+1)=(k+1)(k+2)$$

**RHS** $=(k+1)(k+2) = k^2+ 3k + 2$ 
**LHS** = $2 + 4 + 6 + … + 2k + 2(k+1)$

**INDUCTIVE STEP**

**LHS** = $n(n+1)+2(n+1)$
**LHS** = $k^2 + k + 2k + 2$
**LHS** = $k^2 + 3k + 2$
