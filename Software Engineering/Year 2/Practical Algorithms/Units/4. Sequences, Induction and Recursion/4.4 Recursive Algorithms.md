We've already implemented something like this in: [[2. Big-O Notation]]

- ***Is when a function makes a call to itself***
- ***We keep defining the problem as simpler versions of itself until we get to the base case.***
- ***It works only if***
	- ***There is a base case defined***
	- ***Parameters of the function on successive calls change.***

**Classic example: the factorial function:**

```python
def factorial(n):
	if (n == 1):
		return 1
	else:
		return n * factorial(n-1)

print(factorial(4))
```

We have implemented the factorial function as a recursive algo.

# General Principles for Recursive Algorithms

- When calling itself, a recursive function makes a clone and calls the clone with appropriate parameters.

- A recursive algorithm must always:
	-  **Rule 1**: Reduce the size of the input, each time it is recursively called.
	-  **Rule 2**: provide a stopping case (terminating condition)

# Writing Recursive Functions – Tips

Write the base case first 
- For the rest of the cases, work out how to "reduce" them to simpler cases
	- Arguments/input should "converge" towards the base case 

- Think/visualize in terms of small problem sizes (e.g. FACTORIAL(3))
	- Confirm that the base case works
	- Confirm that these specific, small non-base-case cases work
	- "Convince" yourself that generalizing to arbitrary input sizes will work!

# Linear and Binary Recursion

---
## Linear Recursion
**At most one recursive call at each invocation.**

The amount of space needed, to keep track of all nested calls, grows linearly (wrt the size of the input) 
- The recursion trace is a visualization of space requirements 

Example: FACTORIAL(n) 
- A single recursive call to FACTORIAL(n-1)

```python
def factorial(n):
	if (n == 1):
		return 1
	else:
		return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(10))
```

---
## Binary Recursion
**When an algorithm makes two recursive calls, we say that it uses binary recursion.**
- To solve two halves of some problem

Classic example: Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of numbers defined by 
- Every number in the sequency is the sum of previous two numbers 
- $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$ for $n > 1$ with $F_0 = 0$ and $F_1 = 1$

```python
import functools

@functools.cache
def fibonacci(n):
	if (n <= 1):
		return n
	else: 
		return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

print(fibonacci(4))
```

# Recursion Tree

- Visualizing each recursive call in an algorithm using binary recursion results in a (binary) recursion tree.
- Example for FIB(5)

# Tail Recursion

- Recursion is useful tool for designing algorithms with short, elegant definitions.

- Recursion is useful tool for designing algorithms with short, elegant definitions

- Recursion has a cost
	- Need to use memory to keep track of the state of each recursive call (boxes in recursion traces) 

- Overcoming the cost:
	- When memory is of primary concern, useful to be able to derive non-recursive algorithms from recursive ones
		- Using iterations (e.g. for or while loops)

	- In some cases, we can gain memory efficiency by simply using tail recursion 
	
	An algorithm uses tail recursion when: 
	- **Recursion is linear and …**
	- **Recursive call is its very last operation**

- The main difference between this and traditional recursion is that after concluding it will have to return back up to the parent function.

## Example: Reversing the Elements of an Array

```python
def reverse_array(A, i, j):
	print(f'reverse_array({A}, {i+1}, {j-1})')
	
	if i < j:
	    A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]
	    reverse_array(A, i + 1, j - 1)

list_ = [1, 2, 3, 4]
reverse_array(list_, 0, len(list_) - 1)
print(list_)
```

***These are very easy to change to a non-recursive algorithm.***

## Example: Conversion to Non-recursive Algorithm

- Non-recursive algorithm are also called iterative 
- Algorithms using tail recursion can be converted to a non-recursive algorithm by iterating through repeated operations of functions, rather than calling the function again and again explicitly 
- In general, we can always replace recursive algorithm with an iterative one, but often (not always) the recursive solution is shorter and easier to understand

```python
def reverse_array(A,i,j):
	while i < j:
		print(f'reverse_array({A}, {i+1}, {j-1})')
		A[i], A[j] = A[j], A[i]
		i += 1 
		j -= 1

list_ = [1, 2, 3, 4]
reverse_array(list_, 0, len(list_) - 1)
print(list_)
```
## Example: What Happens when the Function Isn't Tail Recursive.
Converting from Recursive Function to Iterative Equivalent, when the Recursive Function Isn't Tail Recursive.

### Non Tail Recursive
This is due to the multiplication at the end, this means it will have to return to the parent to finish the job.

```python
def factorial(n):
	print(n)
	if n == 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(10))
```

### Tail Recursive
This is gets around returning upwards, this way we calculate on the way down.

```python
def factorial(n, acc=1):
	print(n, acc)
	if n < 2:
		return 1 * acc
	return factorial(n - 1, acc * n)

print(factorial(10))
```

### Iterative
Using the same accumulator strategy we can do this:

```python
def factorial(n, acc=1):
	while n > 1:
		print(n, acc)
		(n, acc) = (n - 1, acc * n)

	print(n, acc)
	return acc

print(factorial(10))
```

# Have You Noticed?
It's all fucking related, BOOOM!!!!
## Recursion in Functions

- Define a function in terms in a way that it calls itself, while every time moving towards a smaller problem size 
- [BASE CASE] Define a stopping case where the function is defined directly, without any recursive calls

## Sequences Defined via Recurrence Relations

- [BASE CASE] We specify the first (or first few elements), and then
- Define a recurrence relation on how to calculate subsequent terms using previous terms

## Mathematical Induction:

- [BASE CASE] Prove something for a base case
- Prove that you can go from a generic case P(k) to its next one, P(k+1)

### Factorial

1a. Implement the FACTORIAL in Python. Draw its recursion trace with pen and paper for factorial(5). The recursion trace should show the sequence of calls as well as the return values from each call (see lecture slides for example). Use print messages to display its recursion trace (e.g., "I am inside the `factorial()` function, with n = …").

```python
def factorial(n):
	print(f'I am inside the `factorial()` function, with n = {n}')
	if n == 1:
		return 1
	else:
		return n * factorial(n - 1)

print(factorial(10))
```

1b. Is FACTORIAL a tail recursive function? Justify your answer.

No since the multiplication on the return means we must return the value to the parent.


1c. Is FACTORIAL a linear recursive function? Justify your answer.

Yes because it only creates one new thread at a time.

Write the LINEAR_SUM function from the lecture slides in chapter 4. Draw its recursion trace for n = 3 and A = [3,6,4,8,7,5,2], and then test it in your program with the same values. Use print messages to display its recursion trace.  The pseudo-code is shown below:

```python
def linear_sum(A, n):
	print(f'linear_sum({A}, {n})')
	if n == 1:
		return A[0]
	else:
		return linear_sum(A, n - 1) + A[n - 1]

list_ = [3, 6, 4, 8, 7, 5, 2]
print(linear_sum(list_, 3))
```

Write the (tail) recursive as well as the iterative version of the "reverse array" function discussed in class. The pseudo-codes are shown below.  Use print messages to display the (recursion) trace of the recursive version.
