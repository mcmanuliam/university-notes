A permutation of a set of distinct objects is an ordered arrangement of objects.

**Example: Let S = {1,2,3}.** 
- The ordered arrangement 3,1,2 is a permutation of S. 
- The ordered arrangement 3,2,1 is another, **DIFFERENT** permutation of S. 

**A generic formula?** 
- Bring in the product rule 
- We are filling "n" boxes 
- First box can be filled in n different ways 
- Second in $n-1$ 
- and so on… 
- So, total number of ways is $n*(n-1)*(n-2)*…*1 = n!$

## r-Permutations
An ordered arrangement of r elements of a set is called an r-permutation.

**Example: Let S = {1,2,3}.** 
- The ordered arrangement 3,1,2 is a permutation of S. 
- The ordered arrangement 3,2 is a 2-permutation of S. 

**The number of r-permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by P(n,r).**
- The 2-permutations of S = {1,2,3} are $1,2; 1,3; 2,1; 2,3; 3,1$; and 3,2. 
- Hence, P(3,2) = 6.

**We can think of the 2-permutation as two boxes that need to be filled:** 
- The first box can be filled in $n_1 = 3$ ways (any one of the three available elements in S) 
- The second box can now be filled in $n_2 = 2$ ways 
- Now we apply product rule: number of ways these two boxes can be filled is $n_1 * n_2 = 6$

**How can we convert this into a generic formula for r-permutation from a set of n elements, i.e P(n,r) = ?**

## A Formula for the Number of r-Permutations
Theorem: If n is a positive integer and r is an integer with 1 ≤ r ≤ n, then there are 
$$P(n, r) = n*(n − 1)*(n − 2)⋅*… *((n − r)+1)$$
r-permutations of a set with n distinct elements. 

**Proof**: Follows from the product rule: 
- n ways to choose the 1st element 
- n-1 ways to choose the 2nd element 
- n-2 ways to choose the 3rd element 
- … 
- $n-(r-1) = (n-r)+1$ ways to choose the rth element 

Hence $P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)$

An r-permutation is an ordered arrangement of size **r** Number of r-permutations equals $P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!$

What happens when n=r? 
- This is the number of ways of permuting (ordering) n elements 
$$P(n,n) = n!/(n-n)!$$$$= n!/0!$$$$= n!/1$$$$= n!$$ The number of ways of permuting n elements equals n!

1. A salesperson has to visit 20 unique cities out of a total of 100, and then return to their base. In how many ways can they do this?

- P(20, 100) Unique cities = $P(100,20) = 100! / (100-20)!$

$$P(20, 100) = 9.3326215443944152681699238856267e+157 / 7.1569457046263802294811533723187e+118$$

$$1.3039950182047124510956853461598 * 10^{39}$$
