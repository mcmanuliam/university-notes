## 1. Basic Query Pattern

**Used When:** All the data is in one table and rows need to be filtered based on a simple static condition.

**Format:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table
[WHERE column_name operator literal_value];
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT aname FROM Pets WHERE housenum = 42;
```

## 2. Equi-Join Pattern

**Used When:** Data is distributed across more than one table, and rows need to be filtered based on data in other rows.

**Format:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table1, table2
WHERE table1.column_name = table2.column_name [AND condition];
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT Employee_ID, Department_ID, Department_Name
FROM Employees AS E, Departments AS D
WHERE E.Department_ID = D.Department_ID;
```

Alternative using **NATURAL JOIN**:

```sql
SELECT Employee_ID, Department_ID, Department_Name
FROM Employees NATURAL JOIN Departments;
```

## 3. Self-Join Pattern

**Used When:** All data is in one table, but rows need to be filtered based on data in other rows of the same table.

**Format:**

```sql
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table AS t1, table AS t2
WHERE t1.column_name = t2.column_name;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT E.name, M.name
FROM Employee AS E, Employee AS M
WHERE E.supervisor = M.NI# AND E.deptno = 5;
```

## 4. Grouping Pattern

**Used When:** Aggregating data by grouping rows based on a column.

**Format:**

```sql
SELECT grouping-columns, aggregation_function(column)
FROM relation(s)
[WHERE condition]
GROUP BY grouping-columns;
```

**Example:**

```sql
SELECT type, AVG(age) AS ageAve
FROM Animal
GROUP BY type;
```

## 5. Aggregate Functions

Aggregate functions operate on column values and return a single summary value.

**Examples:**

```sql
SELECT COUNT(column) FROM table;
SELECT SUM(column) FROM table;
SELECT AVG(column) FROM table;
SELECT MIN(column) FROM table;
SELECT MAX(column) FROM table;
```

## 6. Full Query Structure

**Logical Execution Order:**

1. Form the Cartesian Product from the FROM clause.
2. Eliminate rows not satisfying the WHERE clause.
3. Group remaining rows using GROUP BY.
4. Evaluate expressions in the SELECT clause.
5. Sort results using ORDER BY.
6. Assign column names using AS.
7. Eliminate duplicates if DISTINCT is used.

**Full Query Example:**

```sql
SELECT DISTINCT column AS alias, aggregate_function(column)
FROM table AS alias
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column
ORDER BY column;
```
