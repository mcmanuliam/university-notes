# The main() Function

- The only one required for any C program 
- It denotes the entry point to the program 
	- there can only be one and exactly one 

- It returns an int to signify the exit code
	- 0 = normal execution and termination, i.e. at last statement in main 
	- Non Zero Exit Code = abnormal termination 
	- if no return statement, an implicit return 0 is executed

- **It's good practice to always return 0 if a function executes successfully.**

# Basic Output with Printf

- Defined in `<stdio.h>`, it allows the formatted printing of values
	- The first argument is the format string (using special characters) 
	- The second argument onwards are the values to be printed 
	- The number and order of format strings and values have to match

# \#include

- Instructs the compiler to add comtents of a file to your program.
	- they are include is, i.e. you do not need to modify their logic.
- Include files are usually called *header* files:
	- pre-existing libraries, e.g. \#include \<stdio.h>
	- user-defined e.g. \#include "header.h"
- Commonly used library header files
	- stdio.h
	- stdlib.h
	- string.h
	- limits.h

# Variables

- Variables are essentially just names assigned to memory to store data,
- Have to be defined before using, informing the compiler of the name and the type.
- Naming Conventions
	- Can contain letters, digits, and underscores 
	- Must start with a letter (underscore also accepted, but not recommended) 
	- **Case-sensitive** 
	- Must not be a reserved keyword; e.g. int, return, sizeof
- C is statically typed, similar to typescript although the types get very serious.


# Data Types

- Like I said before C is statically typed but it takes this very seriously.
- What is the meaning of the bit-pattern 1000 0001 ?
	- maybe 129 if using unsigned 8 bit int.
	- maybe 128 if represents a signed 8 but int (2's compliment)
	- maybe blue or an ASCII char? etc…
- The programmer gives meaning to a collection of bits
- The computer needs a way to identify different types
- By declaring a variable with a certain data type we decide what the bit-pattern in memory means

# Variable Declarations

- Before using a variable it must be declared
- A declaration tells the compiler the name and type.
	- The declaration might also initialize a value.
- Using an undeclared variable throws a compilation error
- Variables are stored at locations in memory that do not change over their lifetimes (explained in the next lecture) 
- typedef creates a new name for an existing data type 
	- essentially creating a synonym 
	- typically used with structs

```c
int count
long number, start
float percent = 0.08;
```

```c
typedef int whole_number;
whole_number x = 9;
```

# Statically Typed Variables

-  To assist us writing meaningful programs the compiler enforces that computations preserve the meaningful representation of our data 
	- e.g. for x+1 the compiler ensures that a meaningful addition of the value one and x is performed 
	
- By enforcing operations to respect data types, the compiler prevents meaningless computations

```c
// This will error with
// ./Playground/file0.cpp:3:24: error: invalid operands of types 'float' and 'const char [2]' to binary 'operator+' 3 | float result = percent + "1";

float percent = 0.08;
float result = percent + "1";
```

# Boolean Variables

- In C every integer can be interpreted as a boolean where 0 is false and anything else is false.
- In C99 standard, _Bool was added as a data types
- Is an unsigned int o Values: 0, 1 
- Takes 1 bit of memory 
- Alternative: bool from stdbool.h
	- Values: `true`, `false`

# Symbolic Constants – Two Ways

- The `#define` directive 
	- ***Didn't really understand this in the lecture but it genuinely is very similar to just a find and replace, anytime this name appears replace it with the value assigned.**
	- "hey compiler, find and replace each of these names with this value" 
	- notice: no semicolon 
	- by convention, names are uppercase so they are easy to distinguish 
	- by convention, group all `#define` statements before the main() function 
		- can be placed anywhere, but a constant is only valid for code that follows its `#define` 
		
- The const keyword 
	- a modifier that can be applied to any variable declaration 
	- a value initialized at declaration is prohibited from being changed late

```c
const float pi = 3.14159
#define PI 3.14159
```

# Statements

- An instruction that directs the computer to carry out some task 
- End with a semicolon 
	- except for preprocessor directives such as `#define` and `#include` 
- Are not white-space sensitive

# Loops

- for…while, 
- do…while 
- for..loop
- nested…loops
- Syntax similar to Java

## The Infinite Loop

A loop becomes an infinite loop if a condition never becomes false. The **for** loop is traditionally used for this purpose. Since none of the three expressions that form the 'for' loop are required, you can make an endless loop by leaving the conditional expression empty.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main () {
	for(; ;) {
		printf("This loop will run forever.\n");
	}
	return 0;
}
```

# Switch

 - Lets you execute different statements based on an expression 
 - Useful when the expression can have more than 2 values 
	 - if is limited to evaluating an expression as true or false 
- If a match is found between expression and one of the values: execution is transferred to the statement that follows the case label 
- Otherwise, execution is transferred to the statement following the optional default labeled
 
# Task 2.A

- Write a program that declares a separate variable for each of the following data types: char, int, short, long, long long, unsigned char, unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned long, unsigned long long, float, double, and long double. For this you will need to make use of the sizeof() and printf() functions. 

	- Modify your code to print the size of each variable. 
	- Compile and run your program. Notice the printed values and think about how this affects the overhead of a program. 
	- Now look at limits.h and float.h, and notice the value range that each data type affords.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

// Write a program that declares a separate variable for each of the following data types: char, int, short,
// long, long long, unsigned char, unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned long, unsigned long
// long, float, double, and long double. For this you will need to make use of the sizeof() and printf()

// - Compile and run your program. Notice the printed values and think about how this affects the overhead of a program.
// - Now look at limits.h and float.h, and notice the value range that each data type affords.

int main() {
    // Strings
    char character = 'b';
    unsigned char unsigned_char = 'a';

    // Integers
    short short_int = 12;
    int number = 2000;
    long long_int = 100000;
    long long long_long_int = 100000000;

    // Unsigned
    unsigned short unsigned_short = 12;
    unsigned int unsigned_number = 2000;
    unsigned long unsigned_long = 100000;
    unsigned long long unsigned_long_long = 100000000;

    // Floating-point
    float floater = 18.9f;
    double double_val = 123.45678910;
    long double long_double = 123.456789101112131415L;
    
    printf("Size of char: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(character));
    printf("Size of unsigned char: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(unsigned_char));
    printf("Size of short: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(short_int));
    printf("Size of int: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(number));
    printf("Size of long: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(long_int));
    printf("Size of long long: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(long_long_int));
    printf("Size of unsigned short: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(unsigned_short));
    printf("Size of unsigned int: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(unsigned_number));
    printf("Size of unsigned long: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(unsigned_long));
    printf("Size of unsigned long long: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(unsigned_long_long));
    printf("Size of float: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(floater));
    printf("Size of double: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(double_val));
    printf("Size of long double: %zu bytes\n", sizeof(long_double));

    return 1;
}
```

# Task 2.B

Modify the program from Task 1.B such that the calculation of the number of days depends on a constant defined using the `#define` directive. Set this constant first to the value of 365 and then to 365.2425. Make appropriate changes to your calculation and/or printing logic.

***When ***

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define DAYS_IN_YEAR 365.2425

int main() {
    printf("%s \n", "Liam McManus");
    printf("%s \n", "Games n that (rn Pokemon been fun)");
    
    const int age = 18;
    const float ageInDays = age * DAYS_IN_YEAR;
    printf("%d = %f \n", age, ageInDays);
    return 0;
}
```

# Task 2.C

Write a program to print prime numbers between 1 and 1, 000. A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 or itself. 

- You could identify if a number n is prime by checking whether it is divisible by any of the integers between and including $2$ and $n/2$.

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#define CAP 1000

int main() {
	int index;
	int inner;

	for (index = 2; index <= CAP; index++) {
		bool prime = 1;

		for (inner = 2; inner <= CAP; inner++) {
			if (inner != index && index % inner == 0) {
				prime = 0;
				break;
			}
		}
		
		if (prime) {
			printf("Prime Number: %d\n", index);
		}
	}

	return 0;
}
```
