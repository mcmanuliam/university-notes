# Arrays

- Multiple elements of the same type.
- Accessed using a single name and an index (same as every other language)
	- Index starts at zero
	
- The elements in an array are stored next to each other in memory.
- Arrays that are stored on the stack must have a fixed size (this will be shown later on)
	- So that the memory is automatically managed.
- We can still use dynamic arrays.

```c
_Bool Spartans[300]; // 300 slots of bool assigned.
Spartans[0] = 1;
Spartans[1] = 0;
Spartans[2] = 1;
```

# Array Declaration

- Like any variable, arrays must be declared.
- Declaration must include data type and size `type name[size]`
- Size could be inferred from initialisation, here's an example of size 2 `type name[] = {data_1, data_2}`
- Multi-dimensional arrays
	- as many dimensions as can be held in your memory
	- stored in a row major format, i.e. rows are stored after another.

```c
int array[4, 3] = {{1, 3, 3}, {4, 5, 6}, {7, 8, 9}}
int array[4, 3] = {1, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9} // Same as above
```

# Strings

- A string of characters, i.e. an array of chars:
	- also a char* (more on this later)

```c
char greeting[] = "Hello World";
char greeting[] = {"H", "e", ..., "d", "\0"} // End string char
```

- Strings are terminated by a special character `\0`
	- this is added automatically if you go with the first option.
	- if we forget it, you would read from/write to memory all contents until you hit the next bit pattern equivalent of `\0`
	
- To print a string with `printf` we use `%s` formatting char.

# String Manipulation

- A lot in `string.h`
	-  `strlen` – get length 
	- `strcpy` & `strncpy` – copy contents 
	- `strcat` & `strncat` – concatenate 
	- `strcmp` & `strncmp` – compare two strings, character by character 
	- `strchr`, `strrchr`, `strcspn`, `strspn`, `strpbrk`, `strstr` – search string.

- Can be found in [WikiBooks](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/C_Programming/String_manipulation)

# Structs

- ***These are incredibly similar to interfaces in `TS` in fact they look a bit nicer.***
- It consists of a set of members of different types
- You can access values with the dot notation
	- like public class members in java
- Members are stored adjacently in memory in the order of definition

```c
struct point {
	int x;
	int y;
}

typedef struct {int: x; int: y;} point;
```

# Functions

- A self contained section of  the code to carry out a task
	- modular and reusable
- A very important abstraction mechanism in programming
- A function definition in C looks like this:

```c
return_type function_name(param_type param_name, ...) {
	body
}

int max(int lhs, int rhs) {
	if (lhs > rhs) {
		return lhs;
	} else {
		return rhs;
	}
}
```

- Explanation
	 - return type - the data type of the value that will be returned after evaluating the function 
		 - if no value is to be returned, the special type void is used 
	- function name - a reference, ideally descriptive of the behaviour of the function
	- parameter list - specifies the data type and name of each parameter the function expects 
	- function body - a block containing the code to be executed when calling the function 
	
- To call a function: we provide an argument for each parameter and capture / process the return value

```c
#include <stdio.h>
long cube(long x);
long input, answer;

int main(void) {
	printf("Enter an integer value: 2 \n");
	// scanf("%ld", &input);
	long int input = 2;
	answer = cube(input);
	printf("The cube of %ld is %ld, \n", input, answer);
	return 0;
}

long cube(long x) {
	return x + x + x;
}
```

# Function Declaration and Definition

- A function declaration only specifies how it can be used 
- Function declarations are important for writing modular software
	- it allows to separate the interface (the declaration) from the implementation (the definition)

# How Function Calls Work

## What is a Stack Frame?

Think of the **stack** as a tower of boxes. Each time you call a function, a new "box" (called a stack frame) is added to the tower. This box contains all the information the function needs to run, including:

- **Arguments**: Inputs passed to the function.
- **Local Variables**: Variables defined inside the function.
- **Return Address**: Where the program should go after the function finishes.

## Steps of a Function Call

### Step 1: Caller Prepares the Arguments
Before calling the function, the calling function (called the **caller**) puts the arguments (inputs) onto the stack.

### Step 2: The Function is Called
When the program encounters the function call:

- The address of the next instruction (return address) is saved to the stack.
- Control jumps to the function being called (the **callee**).

### Step 3: A Stack Frame is Created
When the function starts running, a new stack frame is created at the top of the stack. This frame contains:

1. Space for the arguments passed to the function.
2. Space for the return address.
3. Space for the local variables used by the function.

### Step 4: The Function Executes
The function uses the stack frame to:

- Access the arguments.
- Perform operations using its local variables.

### Step 5: The Function Returns
When the function finishes:

1. It puts its result (if any) in a designated place (like a register or specific memory location).
2. The stack frame is removed (popped off).
3. The program uses the return address to jump back to the caller.

# Call by Value

- How are arguments passed to functions when we call them?

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void set_to_zero(int x) {
	x = 0;
}

int main() {
	int y = 42;
	set_to_zero(y);
	printf("%d\n", y)
}
```

- The value 42 will be printed, because when we call a function we pass a copy of the arguments to it 
- `x` and `y` are stored at different memory locations 
- When `set_to_zero` is called the value of y is copied into the memory location of x

**All function calls in C pass arguments by value … except for arrays**
# Call by Reference

- …except for arrays 
- Copying an array could be very expensive (memory-wise) 
- Instead, the address of the first element is passed by value 
- Hence, any changes inside the function happen to the original data 
	- i.e. changes to array elements are now visible outside the function 
- This special treatment of arrays will make more sense when we learn about pointer

# Lexical Scoping (Blocks)

- The stack frame links to literally any kind of blocks
- Variable names must be unique in the same scope.
- For multiple variable with the same name, the variable declared in the innermost scope is used
- Which values will be printed.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int foo(int i) {
	int j = i;
	{
		int i = 0;
		int j = i + 2;
		printf("%d\n", j);
	}
	return j + 1;
}

int main() {
	int i = 5;
	{
		int j = foo(i);
		printf("%d\n", j);
	}
}
```

# Variable Lifetime

- Variables are stored at locations in memory that do not change over their lifetime
- This depends on how the memory for the variable was allocated. There are 3 cases:

- 1. Automatic (Stack)
	- Declared locally in a block
	- Their lifetime ends at the end of a block
	- All variables we have seen so far fall into this category

- 2. Static (Stack)
	- Declared with static keyword
	- The lifetime is the entire execution of program.

- 3. Allocated (Heap - less organised)
	- Explicit request of dynamic memory (using things like malloc)
	- No lifetime, these are managed by dev (covered in next lecture.)

# GNU Make

- GNU make is a very popular build tool.
	- Automats the process of compiling programs.
	- Alternative build systems: `Maven`, `Bazel`, `Gulp` etc…
- A `MakeFile` has the following structure:

```bash
program: source.c
	clang -Wall -Werror source.c -o program
```

- The first two lines form a rule that explain how a target is built 
- The first line is the dependency, made up of "[targets] : [sources]" 
- The target(s) depend on the source(s) § elements in each list are separated by a space 
- The following line(s) are the action 
	- i.e. commands defining how the target is built 
	- need to start with 1 tab 
- `Makefiles` are white-space sensitive! 
- Running make will execute the first rule in the current directory 
- make target will execute the rule to make the named targe
