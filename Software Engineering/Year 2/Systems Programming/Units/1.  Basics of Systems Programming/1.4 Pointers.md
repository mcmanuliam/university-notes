# Memory

-  Definition from the Cambridge Dictionary

1. the ability to remember information, experiences, and people
2. something that you remember from the past
3. **the part of a computer in which information or programs are stored either permanently or temporarily, or the amount of space available on it for storing information**

## How Should We Think about Memory?

 - We can think of memory as a sorting cabinet where each box stores the value of a variable 
 - The variable name is the label which allows us to remember where we stored what
 - We can also think of memory as a single long street where each house has a unique address 
 - We have some notion of spatial locality 
	 - houses close to each other are neighbours; others are far awa

# Byte Addressable Memory

-  Every byte in memory has a unique address 
- On a 64-bit architecture, addresses are 64-bits (or 8 bytes) long 
	- In theory, a 64-bit architecture can address up to 264 bytes = 16 exabytes 
	- In practice, x86-64 only uses the lower 48 bits of an address, supporting up to 248 bytes = 256 TB 
- An address is made up of 12 hexadecimal numbers ∼ 48 bits

# To Manipulate Values in Memory

- We need 3 things
	- get the memory address of a variable (i.e. pointer) 
	- pass pointers (e.g. to functions) for manipulation 
	- set a value at a pointer

```c
#include <stdio.h>

void set_to_zero(int x) {
	x = 0;
}

int main() {
	int y = 42;
	set_to_zero(y);
	printf("%d\n", y)
}
```
# Variables in Memory

 - As we learned: every variable in C is stored at a memory location that does not change over its lifetime 
 - This location is identifiable by its address 
 - Depending on the size of the data type, the value of the variables will span multiple bytes in memory 
 - We can ask for the address of a variable in C using the addressof operator &

```c
int main() {
	int x = 42;
	int y = 23; 
	printf("&x = %p\n", &x); // print the address of x
	printf("&y = %p\n", &y); // print the address of y 
}
```
# Pointers

- We store the address of a variable as the value of another variable that we call a pointer 
- The dereference operator * allows us to access the value of the variable we are pointing to: 
- A pointer to a variable of data type t has the data type t * 
- Every pointer has the same size: the size of an address 
	- on a 64-bit architecture, addresses are 8 bytes (or 64 bits) each 
	- i.e size of a pointer is independent of the type it is pointing t

# Pointers Are Normal Variables

- A pointer is a variable like any other 
- The pointer is stored at its own location 

```c
int x = 42; // stored at 0x7ffeedbed3dc
int * ptr = &x; // stored at 0x7ffeedbed3d
```

- We can get the address of where the pointer is stored using & 

```c
printf("%p\n", &ptr); // prints 0x7ffeedbed3d
```

- We can store the address of a pointer in another pointer 

```c
int * * ptr_to_ptr = &ptr; // stored at 0x7ffeed7ed3c8
```

- We can change where a pointer points to

```c
int y = 23; // stored at 0x7ffeebaf23c4 
ptr = &y;
```

# Pointers and Const

- In C every variable can be annotated with the type qualifier const, indicating that its value can not be changed 
	- This is enforced by the compiler

- Pointers can be const in three ways 
1. The pointer itself, i.e. the address, cannot be changed: `float * const ptr`
2. The value we are pointing to cannot be changed: `const float * ptr`
3. Both value and pointer cannot be changed: `const float * const pt`

# Call-by-value Revisited

- We learned last time that arguments are passed by-value
	- i.e. the value of the argument is copied into the function parameter
- This is also true for pointers

```c
float average(float array[], int size) {
	float sum = 0.0f; 
	for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
		sum += array[i];
	}
	return sum / size;
}
```

- Arrays are treated specially
	- a pointer to the first element is copied instead of the entire array:

```c
float average(float array[], int size);
float average(float * array, int size)
```

- The array is treated like a pointer
	- in fact `int param[]` and `int * param` are interchangeable

# Pointers and Arrays

 - The name of an array refers to the address of its first element 

```c
int vector[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
int * ptr = vector; // this is equivalent to: int * ptr = &(vector[0]);
```

 - We can use the array indexing notation on pointers 

```c
printf("5th element: %d\n", ptr[4]); // prints "5th element: 
```

 - The expressions ptr[i] and *(ptr + i) are equivalent 
 - Two important differences: 
	 - sizeof returns different values (size of array vs. size of pointer) 

```c
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(vector)); // prints '24' (== 6 * 4 bytes) 
printf("%ld\n", sizeof(ptr)); // prints '8' (size of a pointer)
```

- we cannot change an array, only its element

```c
vector = another_vector; // error: array type 'int [6]' is not assignabl
```

# Pointers and NULL

- Sometimes there is no meaningful value for a pointer at a certain time.
- We use the value 0 or the macro NULL to represent pointing to nothing
- NULL often represents an erroneous state
	- e.q. an element was not found in an arrays

```c
// return pointer to value found in array; NULL otherwise 
float* search(float needle, float haystack[], int haystack_size) {
	for (int i = 0; i < haystack_size; i++) {
		if (needle == haystack[i]) {
			return &haystack[i];
		}
	}
	return NULL;
}
```
	
- Dereferencing **NULL** will crash your program! 
	- This has led to many software bugs 
	- The inventor of **NULL**, Tony Hoare, called it his [billion-dollar mistake](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YYkOWzrO3xg&ab_channel=HoigimDang)

# Pointer Arithmetic

- We can use pointer arithmetic to modify the value of a pointer 

	1. add / subtract integer values to/from a pointer 
	2. subtract two pointers from each other 
	3. compare pointers

```c
int vector[6] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}; 
int * ptr = vector; // start at the beginning
while (ptr <= &(vector[5])) {
	printf("%d ", *ptr); // print the element in the array 
	ptr++;
} // go to the next element
```

- Pointer arithmetic takes into account the size of the type the pointer is pointing to

```c
int * i_ptr = &i;
char* c_ptr = &c; 
i_ptr++; // this adds 4-bytes (1x sizeof(int)) to the address stored in i_ptr 
c_ptr+=2; // this adds 2-bytes (2x sizeof(char)) to the address stored in c_ptr
```

# Command line Arguments

- This is the information entered after the program name when you start the program 
- `argc` specifies the number of command line arguments 
- `argv` specifies an array of command line arguments as strings 
- A single string is represented as an array of characters: `char *` 
	- The type of `argv` `char * []` can also be written `char * *`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char * argv[]) { // print every command line argument
	for (int i = 0; i < argc; i++) {
		printf("%s\n", argv[i]);
	}
}
```

# Void *

-  Sometimes we want to write generic code to work with all data types 
	- e.g. swapping two variables or sorting a list 
	- To swap two variables x and y of arbitrary type, we copy all bytes at the location of x to y and vice versa

```c
void swap(void *x, void *y, size_t l) {
	char *a = x, *b = y, tmp;
	while(l--) {
		tmp = *a; 
		*a++ = *b;
		*b++ = tmp; 
	} 
```

- For this we write a function 
	- it takes two pointers and the number of bytes to be swapped 
- void * is a generic pointer 
	- every pointer is automatically convertible to it 
	- only serves as an address pointing to something 🤷 
- We cannot access the value we are pointing to 
	- we do not know what those bits mean 
	- dereferencing a void pointer is forbidden

# Returning a Pointer to a Local Variable

- It is an easy mistake to return a pointer to a local variable. Never do it! 
- Because the pointer has a longer lifetime than the variable it is/was pointing to

```c
struct node* create_node(char value) {
	struct node node;
	node.value = value;
	node.next = NULL;
	return &node;
}

// lifetime of node ends here... 
// but its address lives on in a_ptr

int main() {
	struct node* a_ptr = create_node(‘a’); // ... 
} // lifetime of a_ptr (pointing to node) ends here
```

Solutions 
- Pass the root/leading node, then manipulate it inside the function before node expires 
- Allocate the memory and pass the pointer back


# Function Pointers

- Memory does not store data but also program code 
- It is possible to have a pointer pointing to code 
- These pointers are called function pointers and have the type: return_type (*)(argument_types) 

- This is typically used when passing to another function
	- i.e. telling the second function which function to use at runtime 
	- very useful with design patterns such as command, iterator, visitor 
	
- **Example**: 
	- a sorting function that should compare elements according to their type
	- numbers >; strings `strcmp();` …
	
- Now we can implement a generic print function for a binary tree:

```c
struct node_stuct {
	int valur_ptr;
	node_stuct * left_child;
	node_stuct * right_child;
}

typedef struct node_stuct node;

void print_string(const void * value_ptr) { // takes pointer to void
	char * string = value_ptr; // by changing the type we give the bits meaning 
	printf("%s\n", string);
}

// void (* printing_function)(const void *)
// A function pointer for the printing
void visit(node * root, void (* printing_function)(const void *) ) {
	if (root) {
		printing_function(root->value_ptr);
		visit(root->left_child, printing_function);
		visit(root->right_child, printing_function); 
	} 
} 

int main() {
	node * root = ... ;
	visit(root, print_string); // This will visit the node to print
}
```
