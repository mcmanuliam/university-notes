# Studying the Human

- Used to guide system development
- Continue to measure, refine and experiment

## Historic Interplay

- Trying to create a physiology of HCI
- Based on knowledge of human psychology
	- Perception
	- Cognition
	- Motor Function
- For many in software design communities, first exposure to Psychology basics.
- Engineering-style theories to give approx calculations of how humans would interact.

## Human Processor Model

- **perceptual + cognitive + motor**

## Time Scale of Human Action

- Social Band 
- Rational Band 
- Cognitive Band
- Biological Band 
	- Less relevant for most HCI research/ practice you will be part of

### Cognitive Band

- 100 milliseconds to 10 seconds
	- Pointing devices, selection techniques, text entry, gestural input
	- Time based on reaction times and bio-mechanical properties.

### Rational Band

- Occupy minutes or hours
	- Tasks, like website use, user search strategies, IS navigation
	- Users must experience an interface and make decisions on their next actions.

- Consider an evaluation of user search behaviour
	- How often do users "branch" their search results? 
	- How many "branches" do users generate during a typical search? 
	- Why do users establish a new "branch"

### Social Band

- Days, weeks and months
	- Activities such as workplace habits, social networking, online dating, privacy
	- Require development of social bonds or establishing norms/standards

- Consider a study on people developing relationships in online dating
	- Interviews with members of the community 
	- Participation/observation in active forums

## Model of Human Computer Interaction

- When something goes wrong in a system you can simplify it down to something in this diagram:

## Gulfs of Interaction

- Evaluation: Understanding the state of the system
- Execution: Taking action to accomplish a specific goal
