# Vision

- Light passes through the lens 
- The lens focuses light into an image projected onto the retina 
- The retina converts visible light into neurological signals 
- The centre of the retina, the fovea, processes details

# Hearing

- Sounds are perceived from cyclic fluctuation of pressure 
	- Typically, in air 
	
- Loudness 
	- Subjective perception of sound pressure level 
	
- Pitch 
	- Subjective perception of frequency 
	
- Timbre 
	- Harmonic structure to be described as richness or brightness 
	
- Envelope 
	- Changes in the subjective properties over time

# Touch

 - Touch / haptic 
	 - Through vibration, air, and ultrasound 
	 - For reference: <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663280> 
	 
- Temperature
	- For reference: <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1979316> 

- Pain 
	- We try to avoid this in HCI 

- Proprioception 
	- The ability to sense the position of your body and limbs

# Smell

- Olfaction 
	- The ability to perceive odors

- HCI has explored scent through scent "cubes" 
	- fans that disperse scent, and pressurized delivery systems

- Olfoto: tagging photos with smells vs. text 
	- For reference: <https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1124772.1124869>

# Taste

- Yes, really! 
	- Chemical reception of sweet, salty, umami, bitter, and sour 
	
- TastyFloats 
	- Levitate food onto user's tongue 
	- For reference: <https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3134123> 
	
- Summary of multi-sense interactions
