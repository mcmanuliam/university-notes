# Why Algorithmic's? What is Algorithmic's?

**Algorithmic's:**
- Focuses on the design, analyiss and implementation of algos.
- Encompasses the theory and practical aspects
- aims to develop efficient algos

# Background

**Basic knowledge of java from HTLANL**:
- Java and Java-style pseudocode is used to describe algorithms
- Some algorithms are partially or fully implemented in java

**From Practical Algorithms**:
- fundamental concepts of **graphs**
- terminology and notation of **sets**, **relations** and **functions** 
- basic mathematical **reasoning** and **proof**
- concept of an abstract data type (**ADT**) 
- common **data structures** (e.g., lists, arrays and binary trees) 
- basics of **algorithm analysis** (e.g., time complexity and big-O notation) 
- common **searching** algorithms (e.g., linear search and binary search) 
- common **sorting** algorithms (e.g., insertion sort and merge sort)
