#algo

**Some efficient algos we've covered so far**

- searching a sorted list `O(log n)` (for an array/list of length `n`) 
- finding the max value `O(n)` (for an array/list of length `n`) 
- comparison-based sorting `O(n log n)` (for an array/list of length `n`) 
- distance between two strings `O(n^2)` (for two strings of length `n`) 
- finding a shortest path `O(n^2)` (for weighted graph with `n` vertices)

These are all examples of problems that admit polynomial-time algorithms: their worst-case complexity is `O(n^c)` for some constant `c`

# The Eulerian Cycle Problems

**G** undirected graph: decide whether **G** admits an **Euler cycle**
- an Eulerian cycle that traverses each edge exactly once

**Theorem (Euler, 1736). A connected undirected graph has an Euler cycle if and only if each vertex has even degree**

- therefore we can test whether **G** has an Euler cycle (and find one) in:
	- `O(n^2)` time if **G** is represented by an adjacency matrix
	- `O(m+n)`  time if G is represented by adjacency lists

# The Hamilton Cycle Problems

**G** undirected graph, decide whether **G** admits an **Hamiltonian cycle**
- a Hamiltonian cycle is a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once.

This problem is superficially similar to the Euler cycle problem 
- however in an algorithmic sense it is very different 
- nobody has found a polynomial-time algorithm for Hamiltonian cycle

Brute force algorithm: 
- generate all permutations of vertices 
- check each one to see if it is a cycle, i.e. corresponding edges are present

Complexity of the algorithm (n is the number of vertices) 
- n! permutations will be generated in the worst case 
- for each permutation π, `O(n^2)` operations to check whether π is a Hamiltonian cycle (assuming G is represented by adjacency lists) 
	- worst case: to check an edge is present have to traverse adjacency list of length `n-1` and have **n** edges to check

However: an example where using an adjacency matrix is more efficient as `O(n)` operations are required to check a permutation

As `n` grows, distinction between polynomial and exponential time algorithms becomes dramatic.

This behaviour still applies even with increases in computing power 
- sizes of largest instance solvable in 1 hour on a current computer

This behaviour still applies even with increases in computing power
- sizes of largest instance solvable in 1 hour on a current computer 
- what happens when computers become faster?

The message:
- Exponential-time algorithms are in general "bad"
	- increases in processor speeds do not lead to significant changes in this slow behaviour when the input size is large 
- Polynomial-time algorithms are in general "good"

When we refer to "efficient algorithms" we mean polynomial-time 
- often polynomial-time algorithms require some extra insight 
- often exponential-time algorithms are variations on exhaustive search A problem is polynomial-time solvable if it admits a polynomial-time algorithm

# A Brief Interlude

You are asked to find a polynomial-time algorithm for the Hamiltonian cycle problem.

**Definition**: a problem `Π` is intractable if there does not exist a polynomial-time algorithm that solves `Π`

You could try to prove that the Hamiltonian Cycle problem is intractable

**these difficult problems are known as the NP-complete problems**
