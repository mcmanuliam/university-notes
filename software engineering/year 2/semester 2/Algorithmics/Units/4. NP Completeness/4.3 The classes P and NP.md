#algo

- **P** is the class of all decision problems that can be solved in polynomial time 
- **NP** is the class of decisions problems solvable in **non-deterministic** polynomial time.

P is certainly contained within NP 
- a deterministic algorithm is just a special case of a non-deterministic one 
- but there is no problem in NP that has been proved not to be in P
- the relationship between P and NP is the most notorious unsolved question in computing science 
- there is a million dollar prize if you can solve this question 
- a Clay Mathematics Institute Millennium Prize Problem

# Problem and Problem Instances

- A problem is usually characterised by (unspecified) parameters
- A problem instance is created by giving these parameters values

An NP-complete problem: 
- Name: Hamiltonian Cycle (HC) 
- Instance: a graph G 
- Question: does G contain a cycle that visits each vertex exactly once?

This is an example of a decision problem 
- the answer is 'yes' or 'no' 
- every instance is either a 'yes'-instance or a 'no'-instance

# Non-deterministic Algorithms (NDAs)

An **NDA** "solves" a decision problem Π if
- for a 'yes'-instance I of Π there is some execution that returns 'yes'
- for a 'no'-instance I of Π there is no execution that returns 'yes'

Clearly such algorithms are not useful in practice 
- who would use an algorithm that sometimes gives the right answer

However they are a useful mathematical concept for defining the classes of NP and NP-complete problems

## Example

Graph Colouring:

```java
// return true if graph g is k-colourable and false otherwise

boolean nDGC(Graph g, int k){
	for (each vertex v in g) {
		v.setColour(nonDeterministicChoice(k)); // “guess” a colour for each vertex
	}
	
	for (each edge {u,v} in g)
		if (u.getColour() == v.getColour()) { // “verify” the colouring
			return false;
		}
	return true;
}
```

An non-deterministic algorithm can be viewed as:

- a guessing stage (non-deterministic) 
- a checking stage (deterministic and polynomial time)
