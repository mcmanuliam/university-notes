A decision problem $Π$ is NP-complete if 
1. $Π ∈ NP$
2. for every problem $Π$' in $NP: Π'$ is polynomial-time reducible to $Π$

Consequences of definition
- if $Π$ is NP-complete and can show that $Π∈P$, then $P = NP$
- every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time by reduction to $Π$ 
- supposing $P ≠ NP$, if $Π$ is NP-complete, then $Π∉P$
