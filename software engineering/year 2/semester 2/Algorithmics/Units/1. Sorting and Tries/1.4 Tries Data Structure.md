Binary search trees are comparison-based data structures

**Tries** are to binary trees as `Radixsort` is to comparison-based sorting 
- stored items have a key value that is interpreted as a sequence of bits, or characters, … 
- there is a multiway branch at each node where each branch has an associated symbol and no two siblings have the same symbol 
- the branch taken at level i during a search, is determined by the ith element of the key value (ith bit, ith character, …) 
- tracing a path from the root to a node spells out the key value of the item

Heres an example `trie` containing words from a 4 letter alphabet:

```java
// searching for a word w in a trie t
Node crtNode = root of t; // current node (start at root)
int crtPos = 0; // current position in word w (start at beginning)

while (true) {
	if (crtNode has a child childNode labelled w.charAt(crtPos)) { // can match the character of word in the current position
		if (crtPos == w.length()-1) { // end of word
			if (childNode is an 'intermediate' node) return "absent"; 
			else return "present";
		} else { // not at end of word 
		crtNode = childNode; // move to child node 
		crtPos++; // move to next character of word
		}
	} else return "absent"; // cannot match current character 
}

// inserting a word w in a trie t
Node crtNode = root of t; // current node (start at root)

for (int i=0; i < w.length(); i++){ // go through characters of word w 
	if (crtNode has no child childNode labelled w.charAt(i)){ 
		// need to add new node 
		create such a child childNode; 
		mark childNode as intermediate;
	}
	crtNode = childNode; // move to child node
}
mark crtNode as representing a word;
```

```
0'th index is the letter at each node.
1'st index is whetehr it's a word or not
2'nd index is a pointer to children
3'rd pointer to siblings
```

```typescript
interface TrieInterface {
	letter: string;
	word: boolean;
	child: Pointer<TrieInterface>;
	sibling: Pointer<TrieInterface>;
}
```
