Naive sorting algorithms: `O(n^2)` in worst/average case
- Bubble and Insertion sort.

Clever sorting algorithms: `O(n log n)` in worst/average case
- Merge and Heap (Yet to cover)

The fastest sorting algorithm in practice is Quicksort
- `O(n log n)` on average
- But no better than `O(n^2)` in worst case.

 **Can we come up with a sorting algorithm that is better than O(n log n) in the worst case?**
