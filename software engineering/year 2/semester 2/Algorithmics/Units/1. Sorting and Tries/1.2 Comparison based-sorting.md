**Claim**: No sorting algorithm that is based on pairwise comparison of values can be better than `O(n log n)`.

**Proof**: Describe the algorithm as a decision tree:
- each node represents a comparison between two elements

We have shown the decision tree has at least n! leaf nodes

Comparison-based sorting lower bound We have shown the decision tree has at least n! leaf nodes The worst-case complexity of the algorithm is no better than O(h) 
- where h is the height of the tree 
- an execution is a path from the root node to a leaf node 
- we perform an operation on each branch node so h operations in the worst case
