#algo

**Claim**: No sorting algorithm that is based on pairwise comparison of values can be better than `O(n log n)`.

**Proof**: Describe the algorithm as a decision tree:
- each node represents a comparison between two elements

We have shown the decision tree has at least n! leaf nodes.

Comparison-based sorting lower bound We have shown the decision tree has at least n! leaf nodes The worst-case complexity of the algorithm is no better than O(h) 
- where h is the height of the tree 
- an execution is a path from the root node to a leaf node 
- we perform an operation on each branch node so h operations in the worst case

***See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz1KZXbghj8) for more information, this guy gave really interesting explanation. In summary it's best to think about any decision based sorting algorithm as a binary tree, now after the time on Practical Algorithms, [[3.7 Trees]], you should remember that the best case for navigating a Binary Search tree is no better than *`O(n log n)` hence decision based algorithms are not better than `O(n log n)`.**
