#algo

A systematic way to explore a graph (when starting from some vertex)

# Depth First search/traversal (DFS)

Let's take a look at how this works:

**From starting vertex:**  
Follow a path of unvisited vertices until the path can be extended no further.

then backtrack along the path until an unvisited vertex can be reached

Continue until we cannot find any unvisited vertices.

- Repeat for other components (if any)

**_ESSENTIALLY GO DOWN, THEN TRAVEL BACK UP, GO DOWN, TRAVEL BACK UP ETC._**

The edges traversed form a spanning tree (or forest)

- a depth-first spanning tree (forest)
- spanning tree of a graph is a tree composed of all the vertices and some (or perhaps all) of the edges of the graph.
## Implementation
### Recall Adjacency List Implementation

**Class: adjacency node**

- represents an element of an adjacency list
- includes the index of the corresponding vertex

**Class: vertex**

- represents a single vertex of the graph
- includes linked list of adjacency nodes representing the adjacent vertices

**Class: graph**

- an array of vertices

### Add to Vertex Class

```java
private boolean visited; // has vertex been visited in a traversal?

private int pred; // index of the predecessor vertex in a traversal

public boolean getVisited() { // was this vertex visited?
	return visited;
}

public void setVisited(boolean b) { // on 1st encounter, set as true
	visited = b;
}

public int getPred() { // for when we’re backtracking 
	return pred;
}

public void setPred(int i) { // when we find new vertex during search
	pred = i;
}
```

### Add to Graph Class

```java
/** visit vertex v, with predecessor index p, during a dfs */
private void visit(Vertex v, int p){
	v.setVisited(true); // update as now visited 
	v.setPred(p); // set predecessor (indicates edge used to find vertex)
	LinkedList L = v.getAdjList(); // get adjacency list
	
	for (AdjListNode node : L) { // go through all adjacent vertices
		int i = node.getIndex(); // find index of current vertex in list
		if (!vertices[i].getVisited()) // if vertex has not been visited
			visit(vertices[i], v.getIndex()); // continue dfs search from it
			// setting the predecessor vertex index to the index of v
	} 
}

/** carry out a depth first search/traversal of the graph */
public void dfs() {
	for (Vertex v : vertices) v.setVisited(false); // initialise
	for (Vertex v : vertices) if (!v.getVisited()) visit(v,-1);
	
	// if vertex is not yet visited, then start dfs on vertex w/ predecessor
	// -1 is used to indicate v was not found through an edge of the graph
}
```

## Analysis

Each vertex is visited, and each element in the adjacency lists is processed, so overall `O(n + m)`

- where `n` is the number of vertices and `m` the number of edges

Can be adapted to the adjacency matrix representation

- but now `0(n^2)` since look at every entry of the adjacency matrix

Some applications

- to determine if a given graph is connected
- to identify the connected components of a graph
- to determine if a given graph contains a cycle `(see tutorial 5)`
- to determine if a given graph is bipartite `(see tutorial 5)`

# Breadth First search/traversal (BFS)

Search fans out as widely as possible at each vertex

- from the current vertex, visit all the adjacent vertices this is referred to as processing the current vertex

Vertices are processed in the order in which they are visited therefore visited vertices are added/removed from a `queue (FIFO)`

Continue until all vertices in current component have been processed

- then repeat for other components

Again the edges traversed form a spanning tree (or forest)

- a breadth-first spanning tree (forest)
- spanning tree of a graph is tree composed of all the vertices and some (or perhaps all) of the edges of the graph
## Implementation

Recall adjacency list implementation

Class: adjacency node
- represents an element of an adjacency list
- includes a vertex index (the vertex the element corresponds to)

Class: vertex
- represents a single vertex of the graph
- includes linked list of adjacency nodes representing the adjacent vertices

Class: graph
- an array of vertices

```java
for (Vertex v : vertices) v.setVisited(false); // initialise
LinkedList queue = new LinkedList(); // set up queue 

for (Vertex v : vertices) { // go through vertices in the graph 
	if (!v.getVisited()) { // vertex not visited (start search) 
		v.setVisited(true); // now visited 
		v.setPredecessor(-1); // v initial/starting vertex 
		queue.add(v); // ready to be processed (add to queue) 
		
		while (!queue.isEmpty()) { // something to process
			Vertex u = queue.remove(); // get next vertex from queue 
			LinkedList list = u.getAdjList(); // get adj list for u
			
			for (AdjListNode node : list) { // go through adj list of u 
				Vertex w = vertices[node.getVertexIndex()]; // next vertex in list 
				if (!w.getVisited()) { // not previous found 
					w.setVisited(true); // now visited 
					w.setPredecessor(u.getIndex()); // set predecessor of w to be u 
					queue.add(w); // add to queue
				}
			}
		}
	}
}
```

## Analysis

Each vertex is visited and queued exactly once, each adjacency list is traversed once (when it's processed)

So overall `O(n+m)`
- n is the number of vertices and m number of edges

We can adapt to adjacency matrix representation
- complexity `O(n^2)` as for DFS
- have to access every element of the matrix

#### Application

Computing the distance between two vertices in a graph

- let v and w be to vertices in the graph
- the distance is the number of edges in the shortest path from `v` to `w`

Algorithm

- assign distance to `v` to be `0`
- carry out a breadth-first search from `v`
- when visiting a new vertex for first time, assign its distance to be `1 +` the distance to its predecessor in the BF spanning tree
- stop when `w` is reached

# Distance between Two Vertices

Distance between `v` and `w`

- assign distance to v to be 0
- carry out a breadth-first search from v
- when visiting a new vertex for first time assign its distance to be 1+ the distance to its predecessor in the BF spanning tree
