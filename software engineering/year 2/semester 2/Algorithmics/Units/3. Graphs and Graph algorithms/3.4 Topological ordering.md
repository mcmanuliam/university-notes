A **Directed Acylic Graph** (`DAG`) is a directed graoh with no cycles

A topological order on a `DAG` is a labelling of the vertices 1, …, n such that `(u, v) is a member of E` implies `label(u) < label(v)`

A directed graph `D` has a topological order if and only if it is a `DAG`

Might be better to explain with an example:

**Topological ordering of D**
A topological order on a DAG is a labelling of the vertices 1,…,n such that `(u,v) is a member of E` implies` label(u)<label(v)`

# Topological Ordering Algorithm
Add two integer attributes to every vertex in the graph

**Label** 
- the label in the topological order

**Count**
- initially equals the number of incoming edges (in-degree) of the vertex 
- updated as the algorithm labels vertices 
- always equals the number of incoming edges from vertices not labelled 
	- require the label of this vertex is greater than that of all incoming vertices
	- therefore if all vertices that have incoming edges have been labelled we can just label this vertex with a greater value 
- when attribute becomes zero add vertex to a queue to be labelled
	- any source vertex can be added to the queue immediately

## Implementation

```java
// assume each vertex has 2 integer attributes: label and count 
// count is the number of incoming edges from unlabelled vertices
// label will give the topological ordering 

for (each vertex v) v.setCount(v.getInDegree()); // initial count values 

Set up an empty sourceQueue

for (each vertex v) // add vertices with no incoming edges to the queue 
	if (v.getCount() == 0)
		add v to sourceQueue; // i.e. source vertices 

int nextLabel = 1; // initialise labelling (gives topological ordering)
while (sourceQueue is non-empty) {
	dequeue v from sourceQueue;
	v.setLabel(nextLabel++); // label vertex (and increment nextLabel)
	for (each w adjacent from v) { // consider each vertex w adjacent from v 
		w.setCount(w.getCount() – 1); // update attribute count
		// add vertex to source queue if there are no incoming vertices 
		if (w.getCount() == 0) add w to sourceQueue;
	}
}
```

## Analysis

### (n Vertices, M edges) for Adjacency Lists Representation
- finding in-degree of each vertex is O(n+m) 
	- set the count for each vertex 
	- scan the adjacency list for each vertex
- main loop is executed n times 
	- each time one adjacency list is scanned - that of the vertex being labelled 
	- decrement the count of all vertices that have an incoming edge with the vertex labelled as source 
	- therefore the same list is never scanned twice 
- so every list is scanned again and overall algorithm is O(n+m)


### Analysis (n Vertices, M edges) for Adjacency Matrix Representation
- finding in-degree of each vertex is O(n^2) 
	- scan each column to find the in-degree 
- main loop is executed n times within it one row is scanned O(n) 
	- looking for edges going out 
- so overall the algorithm is O(n^2)
