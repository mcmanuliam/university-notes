#algo

Each edge `e` has an integer weight given by `wt(e)>0`
- graph may be undirected or directed
- weight may represent length, cost, capacity

# Shortest Path (Dijkstra's algorithm)

Given a weighted (un)directed graph and two vertices `u` and `v` find a `shortest path` between `u` and `v` (for directed from `u` to `v`)

## Dijkstra's Algorithm

Algorithm finds shortest path between one vertex u and all others 
- based on maintaining a set `S` containing all vertices for which shortest path with u is currently known 
- S initially contains only u (obviously shortest path between u and u is 0) 
- eventually S contains all the vertices (so all shortest paths are known)

Each vertex v not in S has a label dist(v) indicating the length of a shortest path between u and v passing only through vertices in S
- if no path exists then we set dist(v) to infinity
- first step: if v is adjacent to u then dist(v)=wt({u,v}), otherwise dist(v)=∞ 
- let's see how the algorithm works on an example and then get back to formalising it and the pseudocode implementation

Weighted graph
- Compute shortest path with `u`

```
S={u}

dist(u)=0
dist(v)=8
dist(w)=2
dist(x)=4
dist(y)=∞ // Since it's not adjacent to `u`
dist(z)=∞ // Since it's not adjacent to `u`
```

Find min which is `w` and add to `S`.

```
S={u,w}
```

Then we perform relaxation for all the vertices not in `S`, using values through `w`:

```
dist(vertex) = min{dist(vertex), dist(w) + wt(vertex,w)};
``` 

```
dist(u)=0
dist(v)=8➝min{8,2+7}=8
dist(w)=2 // Already in S
dist(x)=4➝min{4,2+1}=3 // New minimum
dist(y)=∞➝min{∞,2+3}=5
dist(z)=∞➝min{∞,2+9}=11

S={u,w,x}
```

Then we add the new minimum to `S` and repeat with values through `x` util we get to the this:

```
S={u,v,w,x,y,z}

dist(u)=0
dist(v)=7
dist(w)=2
dist(x)=3
dist(y)=5
dist(z)=8
```

### Edge Relaxation

Each vertex v not in S has a label dist(v) indicating the length of a shortest path between u and v passing only through vertices in S:

- suppose `v` and `w` are not in `S` then we know 
- the shortest path between `u` and `v` passing only through `S` equals `dist(v)`
- the shortest path between `u` and `w` passing only through `S` equals `dist(w)`
- now suppose `v` is added to `S` and the edge `e = {v,w}` has weight `wt(e)`
- calculate the shortest path between u and w passing only through `S∪{v}`

Shortest path is either: 
- original path through S of length dist(w) 
- path combining edge e and shortest path between v and u which has length wt(e) + dist(v)

therefore distance updated to:

```
dist(w) = min{dist(w), dist(v) + wt(e)}
```

### Pseudocode

```java
// S is set of vertices for which shortest path with u is known
// dist(w) represents length of a shortest path between u and w
// passing only through vertices of S

S = {u}; // initialise S
for (each vertex w) dist(w) = wt(u,w); // initialise distances

while (S != V) { // still vertices to add to S
	find v not in S with dist(v) minimum;
	add v to S; 
	for (each w not in S and adjacent to v) {// perform relaxation 
		dist(w) = min{ dist(w), dist(v)+wt(v,w)
	};
}
```

Consider two ways of implementing distances dist(v) 
- unordered array − heap

### Complexity

#### Unordered Array
(**n** vertices and **m** edges) using unordered array for distances
- `O(n)` to initialise distances
- finding minimum is `O(n^2)` overall
	- each time it takes `O(n)` and there are `n-1` to finds
- relaxation is `O(m)` overall
	- each edge is considered once and updating distance takes `O(1)`

**hence `O(n^2)` overall (number of edges at most `n(n-1))`**

#### Heap
Analysis (n vertices and m edges) using a heap for distances 
- `O(n)` to initialise distances and create heap 
- finding minimum is` O(n log n)` overall 
	- each time it takes O(log n) and there are n-1 to find 
- relaxation is `O(m log n)` overall 
	- each edge is considered once and updating distance takes O(log n) 
	- **note**: this involves updating a specific value in the heap not the root so care must be taken (need to keep track of positions of vertices in the heap)
