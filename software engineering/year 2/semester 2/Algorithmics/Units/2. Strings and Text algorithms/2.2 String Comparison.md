For a string $s=s_0, s_1, … s_{m-1}$
- `m` is the length of string
- `s[i]` is the `(i+1)th` element of the string
- `s[i..j]` is the substring from the `i`'th to the `j`'th position, i.e. $s_i, s_{i+1}, … s_j$

**Prefixes and Suffixes**
- `j`'th prefix is the `j` character of `s` denoted `s[0..j-1]`
- `j`th suffix is the last `j` characters of s denoted `s[m-j..m-1]`

# Fundamental Question: how Similar, or how Different, Are 2 Strings?

- applications include:
	- biology (DNA and protein sequences)
	- file comparison (diff in Unix, and other similar file utilities) 
	- spelling correction, speech recognition,…

# String Distance

The distance between `s` and `t` is defined to be the smallest number of operations to transform `s` to `t`.

For example consider these strings `s` and `t`:

```
s: a b a d c d b 
t: a c b a c a c b
```

We can show an alignment between `s` and `t` that illustrates how 4 steps would suffice to transform `s` into `t`.

hence the distance between `s` and `t` is less than or equal to 4.

## More Complex Models Are Possible

- e.g. we can allocate a `cost` to each basic operations

## Using Dynamic Programming

- Problem is solved by building up solutions to sub-problems, using recurrsive, eventually we will return the final value.

# Implementation

Bear with me here as this is a bit complicated, we create a recursive function which has 4 different functions, take this as a representation:

Where:

 - `(* *)` is character in `s` matches value at position in `t`.
	 - In this case no ops are required - `d(i-1,j-1)`
	
 - `(_ *)` is where a character is in `t` but not in `s`.
	 -  In this case, **insert** element into `s` and `distance` given by 1 (for the insertion) plus distance between `i`'th prefix of s and `i-1`'th prefix of `t` - `d(i,j−1)`
	
  - `(* _)` is where a character is in `s` but not in `t`.
	  - In this case, **delete** an element from `s` and distance given by 1 plus `distance` between `i-1`'th prefix of `s` and `i`th prefix of `t`
	  
  - `(* $)` is where a character is different.
	  - In this case, substitute an element in `s` and distance given by 1 plus `distance` between `i-1`'th prefix of s and `i-1`'th prefix of t

Leaving us with the recurrence relation:

# Example

```key
subsitution = diagonal cell + 1
delete = above cell + 1
insert = left cell + 1
match = diagonal cell
```

**PLEASE SWAP THE TABLE TO `S/T`, NEVER DO `T/S`**

# Time and Space Complexity both O(m⋅n)

# Traceback Phase

The `traceback phase` used to construct an optimal alignment
- trace a path in the table from `bottom right` to `top left`
- draw an arrow from an entry to the entry that led to it's value.

Interpretation
- `vertical` steps as `deletions`
- `horizontal` steps as `insertions` 
- `diagonal` steps as `matches` or `substitutions` 
	- a `match` if the distance does not change and a `substitution` otherwise

***JUST GO TO THE LOWEST VALUE THEN WE CAN USE THE `d <- h <- d <- d` THING***
