**How do we define this black box?**
- This unit takes a look at three classical models of computation with differing levels of power.

# Finite State Automata

Simple machines with limited memory which recognise input on a read-only .

A **DFA** consists of:
- a finite input `alphabet`
- a finite `set of states`
- an initial/start state $q_0 ∈ Q$ and set of `accepting` states $F ⊆ Q$.
- control of transition relation $T ⊆ (Q × Σ) × Q$
	- $((q,a),q’) ∈ T$ means that in a state `q` and read `a` then move to state `q'`

- deterministic means that:
	- $((q,a_1),q_1), ((q,a_2),q_2) ∈ T$ either $a_1≠a_2$ or $q_1=q_2$
- i.e. for any state and action there is at most one move (i.e. no choice)

A **DFA** defines a **language**
- determines whether the string on the input tape belongs to that language
- in other words, it solves a decision problem

More precisely a **DFA** **recognises** or **accepts** a language
- the input strings which when 'run' end in an accepting state.
## Example

```
INPUT STRING: a, a, b, b, b
```

```
STRING IS ACCEPTED

a, a, b, -> b <-, b
```

## Another One

Recognises the language of strings containing two consecutive a's.

Recognises the complement, i.e., the language of strings that do not contain two consecutive a's.
