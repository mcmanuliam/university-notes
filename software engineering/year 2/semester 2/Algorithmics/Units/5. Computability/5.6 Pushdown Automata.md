# Why?

A finite-state automaton (`DFA`) cannot recognise the language `{ a^n b^n | n ≥ 0 }`
- i.e. a number of `a`'s followed by the same number of `b`'s 
- the problem is the DFA would need to remember n to check that a string is in the language

# How?

A pushdown automaton (`PDA`) consists of: 
- a finite input alphabet `Σ`, a finite set of stack symbols G (same or different) 
- a finite set of states `Q` including `start` state and set of `accepting` states
- control or transition relation:
