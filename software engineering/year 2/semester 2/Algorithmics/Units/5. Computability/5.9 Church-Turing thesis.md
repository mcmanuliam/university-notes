Is the Turing machine an appropriate model for the 'black box'?

The answer is 'yes' this is known as the **Church-Turing thesis**:
- it is based on the fact that a whole range of different computational models turn out to be equivalent in terms of what they can compute 
- so it is reasonable to infer that any one of these models encapsulates what is effectively computable

**Put simply it states that everything "effectively computable" is computable by a Turing machine**.
