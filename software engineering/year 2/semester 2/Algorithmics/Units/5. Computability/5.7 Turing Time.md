# Turing Machines

**A Turing machine is a universal model of computation**
- all computable functions can be defined using a Turing machine.

A **Turing Machine T** to recognise a particular language consists of
- a finite alphabet, including a blank symbol
- an unbound tape of squares
	- each square can hold a symbol of the alphabet.
- a tape head that scans a single square
	-  it can read from it and write to the square.
- a set S of states
	- includes a single start state and two halt states.
- a transition function
	- essentially the inbuilt program

The **transition function** is of the form

```
f : ((S∕{sY,sN}) × Σ) ➝ (S × Σ × {Left, Right})
```

For each non-terminal state and symbol the function f specifies 
- a new state (perhaps unchanged) 
- a new symbol (perhaps unchanged) 
- a direction to move along the tape

## Computation

The (finite) input string is placed on the tape
- assume initially all other squares of the tape contain blanks or 

The tape head is placed on the first symbol of the input 

`T` starts in state $s_0$ (scanning the first symbol) 
- if T halts in state $s_Y$ , the answer is 'yes' (accepts the input) 
- if T halts in state $s_N$ , the answer is 'no' (rejects the input) 
- no condition on what state the tape is at the end (see PDAs)

## The Palindrome Problem

**Instance**: a finite string Y
**Question**: is Y a palindrome, i.e. is Y equal to the reverse of itself

Simple java solution:
`
```java
public boolean isPalindrome(String s){
	int n = s.length();
	if (n < 2) return true;
	else
		if (s.charAt(0) != s.charAt(n-1)) return false; 
		else return isPalindrome(s.substring(1,n-2)); }
```

We will design a Turing Machine that solves this problem.

**For simplicity, we assume that the string is composed of a's and b's**

### TM Algorithm for the Palindrome Problem

```
read the symbol in the current square;
erase this symbol;
enter a state that 'remembers' it;
move tape head to the end of the input;

if (only blank characters remain)
	enter the accepting state and halt;

else if (last character matches the one erased)
	erase it too;

else
	enter rejecting state and halt;

if (no input left)
	enter accepting state and halt; 

else
	move to start of remaining input;
	repeat from first step;
```

**Transitions**: 
- from $s_0$ , we enter $s_Y$ if a blank is read, or move to $s_1$ or $s_2$ depending on whether an a or b is read, erasing it in either case
- we stay in $s_1$/$s_2$ moving right until a blank is read, at which point we enter $s_3$/$s_4$ and move left 
- from $s_3$/$s_4$ we enter $s_Y$ if a blank is read, $s_N$ if the 'wrong' symbol is read, otherwise erase it, enter $s_5$ , and move left
- in $s_5$ we move left until a blank is read, then move right and enter $s_0$

**States**: 
- $s_0$ reading, erasing and remembering the leftmost symbol 
- $s_1$ , $s_2$ moving right to look for the end, remembering the symbol erased 
- $s_3$ , $s_4$ testing for the appropriate rightmost symbol 
- $s_5$ moving back to the leftmost symbol

### TM for the Palindrome Problem
- alphabet is Σ = {#,a,b} where # is the blank symbol 
- states are S = {$s_0$,$s_1$,$s_2$,$s_3$,$s_4$,$s_5$,$s_Y$,$s_N$}

***WHOOOOOOP WHOOOP***, finally finished.

## Functions

The Turing machine that accepts language L actually computes the function f where f(x) equals 1 if x∈L and 0 otherwise.

**The definition of a TM can be amended as follows:** 
- to have a set H of halt states marking the end of the computation
- the function it computes is defined by f(x)=y where 
	- x is the initial string on the tape 
	- y is the string on the tape when the machine halts

**For example, the palindrome TM could be redefined such that it deletes the tape contents and**
- instead of entering $s_Y$ it writes 1 on the tape and enters a halt state
- instead of entering $s_N$ it writes 0 on the tape and enters a halt state

### Example

**Design a Turing machine to compute the function f(k) = k+1** 
- where the input is in binary

**Example 1** 
- input: 1 0 0 0 1 0 
- output: 1 0 0 0 1 1

**Example 2** 
- input: 1 0 0 1 1 1 
- output: 1 0 1 0 0 0 

**Example 3** (special case) 
- input 1 1 1 1 1 
- output: 1 0 0 0 0 0

Design a Turing machine to compute the function f(k) = k+1 
- where the input is in binary

```
move right seeking first blank square;
move left looking for first 0 or blank;

when 0 or blank found
	change it to 1;
	move right changing each 1 to 0;
	halt when blank square reached;
```

## Turing Recognisable and Decidable

A language is Turing recognisable if some Turing Machine recognises it, that is given an input string x:

- if x in L, then the TM halts in state $s_Y$ 
- if x not in L, then the TM halts in state $s_N$ or fails to halt (infinite loop)

A language L is Turing-decidable if some Turing Machine decides it, that is given an input string x:

- if x in L, then the TM halts in state $s_Y$
- if x not in L, then the TM halts in state $s_N$

**Every decidable language is recognisable, but not every recognisable language is decidable**.

## Turing Computability

A function f: Σ*➝Σ* is Turing-computable if there is a Turing machine M such that:

- for any input x, the machine M halts with output f(x)
