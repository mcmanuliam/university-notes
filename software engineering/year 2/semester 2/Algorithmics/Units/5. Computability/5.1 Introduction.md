# Unsolvable Problems

Some problems cannot be solved by a computer
- even with **unbounded time**

Example: The Tiling Problem (decision problem)
- a **tile** is a **1x1** square, divieded into 4 triangles by it's diagonals with each triangle is given a colour
- Each tile has a fixed orientation.

**Instance**: a finite set **S** of tile descriptions
**Question**: can any finite area, of any size, be completely covered using only tiles of types in **S**, so that adjacent tiles colour match?

**There is no algorithm for the tiling problem**, it's been proved that for any algorithm A that we might try to formulate there is a set of tiles S for which either A does not terminate or A gives the wrong answer.

**The Problem is that**:
- "any size" means we do have to check all finite areas and there are infinitely many of these
- And for certain sets of tile descriptions that can tile any area, there is no "repeated pattern" we can use.
- So to be correct the algorithm would really have to check all finite areas.

# Undecidable Problems

A problem Π that admits no algorithm is called non-computable or unsolvable.

If Π is a decision problem and Π admits no algorithm it is called undecidable.

The Tiling Problem is undecidable.
