.**Order of Precedence**:
- closure (`*`) then concatenation then choice (|)
- with brackets used to override this order

**Example**:
- suppose `Σ = {a,b,c,d}` 
	- `R = (ac|a*b)d` means `( ( ac ) | ( (a*) b ) ) d`
	- corresponding language $L_R$ is `{acd, bd, abd, aabd, aaabd, aaaabd, … }`

**Additional operations**:
- complement `¬x` 
	- equivalent to the 'or' of all characters in `Σ` except `x` 
- any single character `?`
	- equivalent to the 'or' of all characters

**The examples from previous lecture over {a,b}**

# Closure

To clarify what `R*` means:
- corresponds to `0` or more copies of the regular expression `R`

Let `L(R)` be the language corresponding to the regular expression `R`
- then concatenation is given by `L(RS) = { rs | r∈L(R) and s∈L(S) }`
- for example: `ab, aab ∈ L(a*b*)`, and hence `abaab ∈ L((a*b*)*)`

Consider the language `(aa*bb*)*`
- i.e. zero or more sequences which consist of a non-zero number of a's followed by a non-zero number of b's

# Problem

A `DFA` cannot recognise `{ r* | r ∈ L(aa*bb*) }`
- i.e. `{ (ambn)* | m > 0 and n > 0 }`
- the problem is the DFA would need to remember the `m` and `n` to check that a string is in the language

Similarly a DFA cannot recognise `{ anbn | n > 0 }`
- i.e. a number of a's followed by the same number of b's

`Pushdown automata` extend finite-state automata with a stack, this should allow us to handle this.
