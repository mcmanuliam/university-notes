A completely different model of computation:
- NO STATES, no transitions and no accepting states

All general-purpose programming languages have essentially the same computational power.
- a program written in one language (e.g., C) could be translated (or compiled) into a functionally equivalent program in any other (Python)

Counter programs have:

- variables of type **int**
- labelled statements are of the form:
	- L : unlabelled_statement

- unlabelled statements are of the form:
	- `x = 0`; (set a variable to zero) 
	- `x = y+1`; (set a variable to be the value of another variable plus 1) 
	- `x = y-1`; (set a variable to be the value of another variable minus 1) 
	- if `x==0 goto L`; (conditional goto where L is a label of a statement) 
	- `halt`; (finished)

# Example

A counter program to evaluate the product xâˆ™y

```
// initialise some variables
u = 0;// dummy variable (always equals 0)
z = 0; // this will be the product of x and y when we finish

A: if x==0 goto C; // end of outer for loop
	x = x-1; // perform this loop x times
	v = y+1; // each time around the loop we set v to equal y
	v = v-1; // in a slightly contrived way

B: if v==0 goto A; // end of inner for loop (return to outer loop)
	v = v-1; // perform this loop v times (i.e. y times)
	z = z+1; // each time incrementing z
	// so really added y to z by the end of the inner loop
	if u==0 goto B; // really just goto B (return to start of inner loop)

C: halt;
```
