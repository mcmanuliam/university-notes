# Why and What?

## Traditional Engineering
- Civil, mechanical, electrical, aviation, automotive, etc 
- Has existed for thousands of years 
- Two key characteristics: 
	- Big Design Upfront (BDUF) 
	- Sequential (Waterfall)

## Software is Different
- Software Engineering ≠ Traditional Engineering
- Software ≠ (cars, bridges, houses, airplanes, phones, etc) 
- Software ≠ (physical products) 
- Software is abstract and flexible

# Problems with Waterfall
- Requirements change
- Customers don't know what they want
- Documentation is overly verbose and quickly becomes outdated.

# The ABC of Software Engineering
Three types of software:
- Type C (Casual) 
- Type B (Business) 
- Type A (Acute)
## Casual Systems
- Common
- Small
- Can have bugs
- Imagine your simple bash scripts
- Main risk is over engineering
## Business Systems
- Very Important
- Systems that benefit from this course
- Tech dept will kill you if you don't adhere to what we learn in this course
## Acute Systems
- Software where nothing can go wrong, big cost
- Mission critical
- Subway, Aviation, Medicine

# Agile
