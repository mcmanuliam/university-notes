# Why Use Arrays?

- Images, Sounds, Videos
- An image is an array of 2d values
- A sound is a 1d array of sound values
- This allows us to easily manipulate data.

## 3D Graphics

- 3D Computer Graphics involves manipulating **geometry**
- Geometry is specified as simple geometric shapes, made up of again… **AN ARRAY** of vertices
## Vectorisation: One Operation, Many Data

- Writing code that acts on arrays of values simultaneously is called vectorised computation.
- This is a special case of parallel computing

## GPUs

GPU's are the most powerful computational units in a machine, although they are dumb and strong, they can only handle lots of simple processes.

## Typing and Shapes of Arrays

### Vector, Matrix and Tensor

**NdArrays** are arrays of `n` dimensions, these also have specific names:

Tensor: **3d**
Matrix: **2d**
Vector: **1d**

```python
 # a vector of length 1 
 [0]
 
 # a vector of length 3 # (e.g. a position in 3D space)
 [1, 2, 3]
 
 # a vector of length 8
 [0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]
```

# Array Operations

- The idea is to generalise all the functions we have seen on sequence types across all dimensions.

The most important ones we will cover are:

- **Slice**: slice out rectangular regions, for reading or writing:
	- Chop out second to tenth rows of a 2D matrix: `x[1:9, :]`
	- Set the second column to 0 `x[:,1] = 0`

- **Filter**: find values in array:
	- You've seen this before: `array.filter(value => Boolean(value));`

- **Reduce**: aggregate across dimensions:
	- Compute a sum of each column: `np.sum(x, axis=0)`
	- Remember don't use `map` and `filter` just use `reduce`.

- **Map**: apply functions or arithmetic operations element wise:
	- `array.map(value => value += 1)`

- **Concatenate and Repeat**:
	- Stick `x` and `y` together on top of each other

# Practical Array Manipulation

## Shape and `dtype`

- Every array is characterised by two things: * the type of its elements: the dtype (e.g.float64) * its shape: that is, its dimensions. For example, 32x8

## `DTypes`

**dtype** just stands for data type, and it is the data of every type of element in an array, remember these are not lists these are arrays.

We can interogate an array to see it's shape and dtype:

```python
import numpy as np

x = np.zeros((3,3))
print('dtype =',x.dtype)
print('shape = ', x.shape)

# dtype = float64 shape = (3, 3)
# dtype = float64 shape = (3, 3)
```

## Images and Sounds

Images and sounds are classic examples of arrays. They are naturally manipulated using array abstractions. For example, we can load an image from disk, and its shape will be its resolution:

```python
from matplotlib.image import imread

img = imread('imgs/rocks.png')
print(type(img),",",img.dtype,",",'shape = ',img.shape)

# <class 'numpy.ndarray'>, float32, shape = (287, 400, 3)
```

# Array Ops: Creation, Indexing, Slicing, Joining and Rotating

## Mutability and Copying

`np.array()` can take any sequence, including another `ndarray`, So it can be used to copy arrays:

This is important, because NumPy are **mutable**, and if several variables refer to the **same** array, the effects might not be what you expect.

```python
x = np.array([1,2,3]) 
z = x # By reference rn
x[0] = 0

print(x) # [0 2 3]
print(z) # [0 2 3], da fuq?
```

We need to explicitly copy arrays if we want to work on a new array:

```python
x = np.array([1,2,3])
y = np.array(x) # copy 
z = x.copy() # same thing as using np.array(x)
x[0] = 0

print(x) # 0 2 3 
print(y) # still [1 2 3]
print(z) # [1 2 3]
```

# Blank Arrays

There are a number of methods all of which do essentially the same thing; allocate a new array with a given shape, and possibly fill it with a value.

- `np.empty(shape)`, which allocates memory for an array, but does not initialise it 
- `np.zeros(shape)`, which initialises all elements to 0 
- `np.ones(shape)`, which initialises all elements to 1 
- `np.full(shape, value)` which initialises all elements to value

These are just calling `np.empty` to create a new array and populating.

# Random Arrays

We can also generate random numbers to fill arrays. Many algorithms use arrays of random numbers as their basic "fuel".

- `np.random.randint(a,b,shape)` creates an array with uniform random integers between a and (excluding) b 
- `np.random.uniform(a,b,shape)` creates an array with uniform random floating point numbers between a and b 
- `np.random.normal(mean,std,shape)` creates an array with normally distributed random floating point numbers between with the given mean and standard deviation

```python
# a 32x32 block of random numbers
show_image_mpl(np.random.uniform(0, 1, (32, 32)))
```

# Ranges

We can create a vector of increasing values using `arrange` (array **range**), which works like the built in Python function **range** does, but returns an ID array instead of a list.

`np.arange()` takes one to three parameters: *` np.arange(end)` – returns a vector of numbers 0..end-1 * `np.arange(start, end)` – returns a vector of numbers start..end-1 * `np.arange(start, end, step)` –returns a vector of numbers start..end-1, incrementing by step (which may be negative and/or fractional!)

```python
np.arange(10) # array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
np.arange(5,10) # array([5, 6, 7, 8, 9])
np.arange(0, 10, 2) # array([0, 2, 4, 6, 8])
```

# Linspace

`np.arange` is useful for generating evenly spaced values, but it is parameterised in a form that can be awkward. `np.linspace(start, stop, steps)` is a much easier to use alternative. linspace stands for "linearly spaced", and it generates steps values between start and stop inclusive.

# Loading and Saving Arrays

I/O with arrays is a critical part of any numerical computation system. There are a huge number of ways to store and recall arrays, including: * simple text formats like CSV (comma separated values) * binary formats for storing single or multiple arrays like mat and npz * specialised scientific data formats like HDF5 (often used for huge datasets) * domain-specific formats like images (png, jpg, etc.), sounds (wav, mp3, etc.), 3D geometry (obj, …)

## Example

We have two files:
- `np.loadtxt(fname)` and 
- `np.savetxt(arr, fname)`

work on simple text files.

```python
# this just turns off scientific notation, so the output looks sensible! 
np.set_printoptions(suppress=True)

# load and print, in a single array
sunspots = np.loadtxt("data/sunspots.csv", delimiter=',')
print(sunspots)

np.savetxt("data/sunspots_out.csv", sunspots)

# [[ 1. 1749. 58. ]
# [ 2. 1749.08333333 62.6 ]
# [ 3. 1749.16666667 70. ]
# …
# [2818. 1983.75 55.8 ]
# [2819. 1983.83333334 33.3 ]
# [2820. 1983.91666667 33.4 ]]
```

# Slicing and Indexing Arrays

Arrays can be indexed like lists, indexing and it's counterpart slicing, are two of the most important array operations.

The general format follows the same structure as `arrange()`, taking 0-3 params separated by a `:`

```
start : stop : step
```

## Examples:

```python
print(sunspots[:, 1]) # second column (remember 0-indexing!)
# [1749. 1749.08333333 1749.16666667 … 1983.75 1983.83333334 1983.91666667]

print(sunspots[0, :]) # first row (note the row=0, column=any)
# [ 1. 1749. 58.]

# first ten rows, second column onwards (start specified, but not stop) 
print(sunspots[0:10, 1:])

# every tenth row, up to row 100, second column onwards # note this uses the full start:stop:step slicing 
print(sunspots[0:100:10, 1:])

# whole array, every sixtieth row. Note that start and stop are *both* omitted␣ ↪here # and only step is given.
print(sunspots[::60, :])

print(sunspots[0, 1]) # first entry in second column 
# note that there is no colon here; this indexes rather than slices

print(sunspots[0]) # indexes first row, does reduce rank
print(sunspots[0].shape) # indexes first row, does reduce rank
```

# Sounds

Likewise, we can chop out a bit of a sound by slicing, or even reverse it and pitch it up:

```python
snd = load_sound("sounds/guitar.wav")
play_sound(snd) # original

play_sound(snd[4000:18000]) # slice
play_sound(snd[::-1]) # backwards
play_sound(snd[::2]) # double speed (horrible interpolation+aliasing artifacts)
```

# Transposition

A particularly useful transformation of an array is the transpose which exchanges rows and columns (this isn't the same as rotating 90 degrees!). There is special syntax for this because it is so often used:

We write `x.T` to get the transpose of `x`:

```python
# square example
x = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [0, 0, 0], [4, 5, 6]])
print_matrix("x", x)

# [[1 2 3] [0 0 0] [4 5 6]]

print_matrix("x^T", x.T)
# [[1 0 4] [2 0 5] [3 0 6]]

tensor = np.zeros((10,5,60,2)) # 10 x 5 x 60 x 2 array

print("Original shape\t\t", tensor.shape) # (10, 5, 60, 2)
print("Transposed shape\t", tensor.T.shape) # (2, 60, 5, 10) dimensions in reverse order
```

# Flip, Rotate

As well as transposition, arrays can also be flipped and rotated in a single operation using indexing (there are also convenience functions like fliplr and `rot90` but we will keep it simple here):

```python
print_matrix("x", x)

# left-right flip
print_matrix("\\text{fliplr}(x)", x[:, ::-1]) # ::-1 --> reverse order

# up-down flip
print_matrix("\\text{flipud}(x)", x[::-1, :])
```

Now we can start playing with images, I present to you… Owl:

![[Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 15.55.40.png]]

```python
# flip up-down
show_image(owl[::-1, :], width="50%")
```

![[Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 15.56.07.png]]

```python
# flip left-right
show_image(owl[:,::-1], width="50%")
```

![[Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 15.56.33.png]]

```python
# rotate 90
show_image(owl[::-1, :].swapaxes(0,1), width="50%")
```

![[Screenshot 2025-03-31 at 15.57.03.png]]

```python
# split the owl into a left and right half 
h,w,d = owl.shape 

left = owl[:, :w//2, :] # //2 just means integer division by 2 (i.e. no␣ ↪floating point part)
right = owl[:, w//2:, :] 

## we'll see concatenate in a moment 
show_image(np.concatenate([left, left[:,::-1]], axis=1), width="50%") #show_image(np.concatenate([right[:,::-1], right], axis=1), width="50%")
```
