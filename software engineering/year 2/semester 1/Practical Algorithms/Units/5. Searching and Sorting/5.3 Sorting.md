The process of putting elements in a collection in some kind of order 

- E.g.: 
	- numbers sorted numerically 
	- words sorted alphabetically 

- Can be ascending or descending order 
	- We will work with ascending order as the default 
	- â€¦.the algorithm for descending would be very similar 
	
- There are many, many, (way too many) sorting algorithms out there. 
	- Utility varies depending on size of problem, problem context, etc. 

- Typical operations required for sorting would be: 
	- comparing 
	- changing (or exchanging) and element's position 
	- in some cases, copying parts of a list back and forth

## Bubble Sort

We have done this earlier: 
- Multiple passes through a list 
- Compare adjacent items, exchange if out order. 
- Larger items "bubble" to the right (in case of ascending order)

```python 
def bubble_sort(array):
	n = len(array)
	
	for outer in range(n - 1):
		for index in range(n - outer - 1):
			if array[index] > array[index + 1]:
				temp = array[index] 
				array[index] = array[index + 1] 
				array[index + 1] = temp 
	
	return array

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(bubble_sort(array))
```

## Insertion Sort

 Quite likely the go-to way most people would sort their playing cards in a game 
 - Create a sorted sub-list 
 - start with one element in that sorted sub-list (single element list is always sorted!) 
 - one element from the un-sorted portion of the list 
 - insert it at the correct position in the sorted sub-list 
 - keep doing this until you reach the last element

```python
def insertion_sort(array):
	for outer, _ in enumerate(array):
		key = array[outer]
		inner = outer
		
		while inner > 0  and array[inner - 1] > key:
			temp = array[inner - 1]
			array[inner - 1] = array[inner]
			array[inner] = temp
			
			inner -= 1
		
		array[inner] = key
	
	return array

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(insertion_sort(array))
```

## Merge Sort

Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm 
- **Divide** the n-element array to be sorted into two subarrays of $n/2$ elements each
- **Conquer**: Sort the two subarrays recursively using MERGE-SORT 
- **Combine**: Merge the two sorted subarrays to produce the sorted answer 

Key Operation: How to "merge" two sorted arrays
- Scan L (left) and R (right) 
- At each iteration, copy the minimum to A 
- Advance the iteration on L (or R) only if the minimum is picked from L (or R) 
- We will use this idea plus some some improvements to define algorithm MERGE

**This is a bit complicated to understand, here's a chatGPT explanation to make it a bit easier to understand.**
### Example
Imagine you have the list `[8, 4, 7, 3]`.

1. **Divide** $o(n \log(n))$:
    - `[8, 4, 7, 3]` â†’ `[8, 4]` and `[7, 3]`
    - `[8, 4]` â†’ `[8]` and `[4]`
    - `[7, 3]` â†’ `[7]` and `[3]`
    
2. **Merge** $o(n)$:
    - `[8]` and `[4]` â†’ `[4, 8]` (compare and arrange)
    - `[7]` and `[3]` â†’ `[3, 7]`
    
3. **Final Merge**:
    - `[4, 8]` and `[3, 7]` â†’ `[3, 4, 7, 8]` (compare and arrange).

Okay might be better to explain this one with some code.

```python
def merge_sort(array, start = 0, end = len(array) - 1):
    if start < end:
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        merge_sort(array, start, mid)
        merge_sort(array, mid + 1, end)
        merge(array, start, mid, end)

def merge(array, start, mid, end):
    left = array[start:mid + 1]
    right = array[mid + 1:end + 1]
    
    left.append(float('inf'))
    right.append(float('inf'))
    
    left_index = right_index = 0
    
    for index in range(start, end + 1):
        if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:
            array[index] = left[left_index]
            left_index += 1
        else:
            array[index] = right[right_index]
            right_index += 1

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
merge_sort(array)
print(array)
```

***Pushing infinity fixes the index out of range problem, imagine looping through two arrays, one of length 5 and 6 if you try to index at 6 in the length 5 it'll give index out of range but if you add infinity it won't throw error, this can also be represented as three while loops***

```python
while left_index < len(left_index) && right_index < len(right_index):
	if left[left_index] <= right[right_index]:
		array[index] = left[left_index] 
		left_index += 1
	else: 
		array[index] = right[right_index] 
		right_index += 1

while left_index < len(left_index):
	array[index] = left[left_index] 
	left_index += 1

while right_index < len(right_index):
	array[index] = right[right_index] 
	right_index += 1
```

## Quick Sort

Efficient divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm, like merge-sort 
- But, unlike merge-sort, is in-place, so does not use additional memory 
- and can often (though not always) be quicker in practice than merge sort 
- but the trade-off is: sometimes, the "divide" step does not divide in half, and in the worst case, can go back to O(n2) time complexity

To sort a subarray A[start..end]A[\text{start}..\text{end}]A[start..end], Quicksort works like this:

1. **Divide**: Choose a pivot index and split the array into two parts:
    - A $\text{start}..\text{pivot}-1$: All elements less than or equal to the pivot.
    - A $\text{pivot}+1..\text{end}$: All elements greater than the pivot.
    
2. **Conquer**: Recursively apply Quicksort to the two subarrays.
3. **Combine**: No extra work is needed because the array is sorted after the recursive steps.
    

The core of Quicksort is the partitioning step in the "Divide" phase.

1. Implement theÂ **bubble sort**Â algorithm in Python. Sample solution is available in earlier chapters, but try do it yourself first. I would suggest writing the pseudo-code yourself first too, maybe making use of deck of cards to work through the algorithm mentally first.

```python
def bubble_sort(array):
	n = len(array)
	
	for outer in range(n - 1):
		for index in range(n - outer - 1):
			if array[index] > array[index + 1]:
				temp = array[index]
				array[index] = array[index + 1]
				array[index + 1] = temp 
				
	return array

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(bubble_sort(array))
```

1. Now, implement theÂ **insertion sort**Â algorithm in Python. You have therepseudo-code in the lecture slides, though again as an exercise see if you can write it again from ground up.

```python
def insertion_sort(array):
	for outer, _ in enumerate(array):
		key = array[outer]
		inner = outer 
	
		while inner > 0 and array[inner - 1] > key:
			temp = array[inner - 1]
			array[inner - 1] = array[inner]
			array[inner] = temp 
		
			inner -= 1
			array[inner] = key
			
	return array 

array = [1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 2, 234, 45, 234, 13, 34, 56, 12, 23, 8, 9, 10]
print(insertion_sort(array))
```

1. a) Merge Sort

```python
```

1. b) Quick Sort

```python
def quicksort(array, lower = 0, upper = None):
	if not upper:
		upper = len(array)
	
	if lower < upper:
        pivot = partition(array, lower, upper)
        quicksort(array, lower, pivot - 1)
        quicksort(array, pivot + 1, upper)

def partition(array, lower, upper):
	pivot = array[upper - 1]
	left = start - 1

	for index in range(lower, upper - 1):
		if array[index] <= x:
			left += 1
			array[left], array[index] = array[left], array[index]

	new_left = left + 1
	array[new_left], array[upper] = array[upper], array[new_left]
	return new_left

my_array = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90, 5]
quicksort(my_array)
print("Sorted array:", my_array)
```

The template code closely follows the pseudo-codes for each of the above discussed in class, also available in the appendix of this lab sheet; you should keep that pseudo-code in front of you when completing the exercise. You may even find it useful to copy and paste the pseudo-code into your python code, but do remember that considerable changes need to be made, e.g. to syntax at some places, and especially at how the indices are specified when slicing an array or specifying a range for looping.

You are to complete the sorting algorithms. Find the tag <YOUR_CODE_HERE> throughout the code, and then try to complete it on your own.

If you were to write the code entirely on your own, it would likely look quite different from the template provided here, and that's fine too (in fact, encouraged!)
