You can think in terms of sets: we are interested in finding how many subsets of a certain size can be created from a given, larger set. 

- "subset" indicates order is not important.

***Essentially just think of the combination of a set without thinking about order.***

## r-Combinations
An r-combination of elements of a set is an unordered selection (or arrangement) of r elements from the set.

- Thus an r-combination is simply a subset of the set with r elements
- If ordering/permutations are ignored, then permutations overcount

The number of r-combinations of a set with n distinct elements is denoted by `c(n,r)`
- Often pronounced: n choose r
- The notation (n over r) is also used and is called a binomial coefficient*

## A Formula for the Number of Combinations?
Given: S = {1,2,3}

The number of r-permutations of a set with n elements is denoted by `P(n,r)`. 
- We know its formula: $P(n,r) = n!/(n-r)!$
- The 2-permutations of $S = \{1,2,3\}$ are: $1,2; 1,3; 2,1; 2,3; 3,1; 3,2$

There are however three r-Combinations, because order does not matter: 
- $1,2; 1,3; 2,1; 2,3; 3,1; 3$,

All possible permutations of a certain set of elements (e.g. $\{1,2\}$ has 2 permutations: (1,2) and (2,1)) should be counted as one combination.

So, we need to divide the total number of r-Permutations by the number of ways we can rearrange r elements

- i.e. permute r elements in a size of r 
- recall the number of ways of permuting r elements, `P(r,r)`, equals r! 

Follows that the number of r-combinations of a set of size n is therefore given by 
$$C(n,r) = P(n,r)/r!$$$$= (n!/(n-r)!)/r!$$$$= n!/(r!⋅(n-r)!)$$
## Combinations versus Permutations
`P(n,r)` can be constructed from `C(n,r)`
- first generate the `C(n,r)` combinations (where ordering does not matter) 
- each combination is of size r 
- now permute each of the combinations (ordering now matters) 
- this increases the number of each combination by r!

$$P(n,r) = C(n,r)⋅r!$$
$$= (n!/(n-r)!r!)*r!$$ $$= n!/(n-r)!$$
The number of r-combinations of a set of size n is the same as the number of `(n-r)`-combinations
- for an r-combination, the elements left over form an (n-r)-combination 
- therefore `C(n,r)` = `C(n,n-r)`

Given a fixed element e from a set of size n the r-combinations of the set can split into disjoint two sets:
- those that contain the element e which is of size `C(n-1,r-1)`
- those that do not contain the element e which is of size `C(n-1,r)`

Leads to the recurrence relation: 
$$C(n,r) = C(n-1,r-1) + C(n-1,r)$$
