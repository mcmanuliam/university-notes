#### What is a Relation??
- A relation may be thought of as a 2D table. (It's a table, we are not walking around this bullshit).
- A relation has:
	- a name - `STUDENT`
	- In the header: an unchanging set of columns which are named and typed (domain) â€“ i.e. the scheme 
		- `Student(name, StudentID, exam1, exam2)`

	- In the body: a time varying set of tuples, which are the current set of records for the relation

- The relation has
	- Degree - number of attributes
	- Cardinality - number of rows/columns.

#### Characteristics of the Relational Model
- **A relation is a set of tuples**
	- e.g.` {<Fraser,880123,50,65>, â€¦.}`

- **There are no duplicate tuples**
	- because the tuples form a set
	- this must be checked when
	- a new tuple is added
	- a value is modified
	- a new relation is created as a restriction of an old one
	
- **This implies that a primary key always exists**
	- Worst case = a key composed of all of the attributes
	
- **The tuples are unordered**
	- a property of sets
	- no meaning is imposed on the relation (we could use any order)
	- a table is only one possible representation of a relation
	- physical storage of a relation must however have an order

- **Attributes are also an unordered set**
	- nothing can be inferred from the way we write the set of names or draw a table representation
	- no notion of getting the first attribute, next attribute, etc.
		- no first tuple or next tuple

- All values are atomic
	- no attribute can have a value which is either a set or is decomposable
	- So NO MULTI-VALUED attributes

| S#  | PQ                     |
| --- | ---------------------- |
| S1  | {(P1, 200), (P2, 300)} |
Must Become

| S#  | P   | Q   |
| --- | --- | --- |
| S1  | P1  | 200 |
| S1  | P2  | 300 |

- Another way to handle this would be to do a separate table which includes this, imagine like roles.

#### Null Values
When adding a new tuple, we might not have all the data we need 

![[image22.png]]

- The tuple for `STUDENT` Smith has a NULL value for Exam2 
- This is okay if the model allowsâ€¦.but what about if we wanted a `NULL` value for matric number? 
	- Primary keys cannot be allowed to take `NULL` values

#### Integrity

**Constraints on Relational Databases**

**Inherent integrity constraints:** 
- must hold for all relational databases 
- typically enforced by DBMS

**Enterprise constraints**: 
- specific to a particular application

##### Integrity Constraints
- Primary key values must be unique 
- Primary key values cannot be `NULL` 
- Foreign key values:
	- must exist in the primary key of the referenced relations â€“ we call this referential integrity 
	- may be `NULL` (if it is not a mandatory participation)

- NB: In MySQL, foreign keys are constraints that need a unique name. 
	- I suggest a notation including both tables: e.g. `"fk_Star_Studio"`

##### Enterprise Constraints
- Application dependent
- Examples:
	- specified non-key attributes must not be `NULL` e.g.: all students must have a name, even if the primary key is the student number
	- values of one attribute must be less than values in another attribute e.g.: age of parent must be greater than age of child

- `SQL` standards compliant `DBMS` platforms allow user-defined constraints to be checked when data is inserted/updated 

#### Referential Integrity
- Concerns the use of Foreign Keys
- Guarantees that relationships between tuples are coherent
	- Every non-`NULL` value in a Foreign Key must also exist in the relation for which it is the Primary Key

##### 3 Strategies
- **Restrict** â€“ ban any alterations to a primary key if there are foreign key references to it
- **Cascade** - cascade the effect to all relations in all tables that refer to it
- **Set to NULL** â€“ allow update in original table, set all corresponding FK values to null

##### Examples

Schema:
```
Staff(Payroll# : INT, name: VARCHAR(10))
Students(matric# : INT, name : VARCHAR(10), adviser : INT)
```

A foreign key constraint exists, where `Students.adviser` refers to `Staff.payroll#`, we can't just input any INT.

![[image23.png]]
***We shouldn't allow `NULL` here.***

What is the domain of the the adviser attribute? 
`Adviser : { 8000, 8450, 8856, NULL }

- What to do if the referent of a foreign key is changed (edited or deleted)?
`
1. What if Lennon's payroll number changes to 7990? 
	- Change number in `STAFF` and set to `NULL` in Student

2. What if Gray's record is deleted?
	- Remove in `STAFF` and cascade to Student
	- If Student must have advisor - Restrict - throw Err 
		- ERROR 1451: Cannot delete or update a parent row: a foreign key constraint fails

#### Integrity in MySQL Workbench
Integrity â€“ controlled by a dialogue box
- See Foreign Keys Tab of Table Editor

**Our Schema:** 
Movie(Title, Type, Studio, SequelOf) 
Release(MovieTitle, Year, Length) 

where Release Title is a FK reference to Movie Title

1. Check that Movie's Title is a Primary Key
	- And note its datatype e.g. VARCHAR(50)

2. Create all attributes in Release, including those attributes that will be Foreign Keys 
	- Make sure that FKs attributes have correct datatype â€“ it MUST be the SAME as the PK attribute you intend do refer to
	- Press Apply BEFORE creating the FK constraints

3. Add a Foreign Key constraint for Release
	- Name the constraint, e.g. "fk_release_movie"
	- Select Movie as the referenced table
	- Select MovieTitle as the (foreign key) column of this table, and Title as the referenced (primary key) column 

4. Choose a referencing strategy (e.g. CASCADE)

#### FK Checklist
- Foreign Keys are difficult! If things go wrong: 
1. Do not panic 
2. Read the SQL error message, it will give a hint 
3. Checkâ€¦ 
	- â€¦ that you are referencing a PK
	- â€¦ that the datatypes of the PK and FK attributes match
	- â€¦ If you have a composite PK, you must also have a composite FK 
4. Google the error message 
5. If all else fails, close the Workbench tabs and try again

***Notes from future Liam, we are starting on actual Practical work***, I believe we are planning on setting it up through remote SQLServer so rather than setting that up I'm gonna make an attempt to do this through **docker** and **bee**.

We will be using MySQL in the course to build and query a database. There are two components that are needed to use MySQL:  
  
- A MySQL server, which is provided by the School.
- An application called MySQL Workbench, which is used to create and manipulate databases on the server.
  
You can install MySQL Workbench on your own computer and use it to connect to the school's MySQL server. Download MySQL Workbench fromÂ [MySQL.com](https://www.mysql.com/)Â ([direct link here](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)). Alternatively, if you are familiar with the university's Windows Virtual Desktop environment, you can use MySQL Workbench from there. In either case, when you start using MySQL Workbench, you need to connect it to a server. Instructions for setting up MySQL Workbench with a remote MySQL server are availableÂ [here](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/workbench/en/wb-getting-started-tutorial-create-connection.html).  
  
The address of the School's server is socs-db.dcs.gla.ac.uk and it uses the default port number. Your username is GA_ followed by your GUID (lower case letter) and your password is GA_12345678, where the digits are the last 8 digits from your barcode number on your university ID card.  
  
If you are using MySQL Workbench on your own computer, then in order to access the school's MySQL server you need to be either using the eduroam wifi network on campus or using the university VPN. Instructions on how to connect to the VPN can be found onÂ [myglasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/it/vpn/).  
  
***If you want to work with MySQL entirely on your own computer, another possibility is to install your own MySQL server and access it using the localhost address.*** - I've went with this.
