# Sets and Set Theory
**Set theory** is the branch of mathematics that studies **sets**

**Sets** are collections of objects
- The set of all numbers
- the set of all animals with tails 
- the set of letters in the alphabet
- the set of all students in a class

Objects in a set are called `elements` or `members` of a set, A set is said to `contain` its elements

In databases
- all exam scores make up a `set` of exam scores.
- all employees of a company make up a `set` of employees

## Describing Sets
Describing a set
- List all the members between braces
	- E.g.` {a, b, c, d}`
	- Represents the set with the four elements `a, b, c,` and `d`.

E.g. The set V of all vowels in the English alphabet 
- `V = {a, e, i, o, u} `• E.g. 

The set O of positive integers less than 10
- `O = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9 }`

| | denotes the cardinality of a set
- `|V| = 5, |O| = 5`

## Set Builder Notation
pecify the property/properties that characterize its membership:

```python
𝑆 = {𝑥 | 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑎 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛 100}
𝑂 = {𝑥 | 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑎𝑛 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑔𝑒𝑟 𝑙𝑒𝑠𝑠 𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛 10}
𝑃 = {𝑥 ∈ ℤ+ | 𝑥 𝑖𝑠 𝑜𝑑𝑑 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑥 < 10}
# ^ x is in Z and x is odd and x < 10 (this could be on the right but it's normal o do it on the left with set members), the plus is essentially a filter to positive numbers, in the case there is a star that means the zero get's filtered.

O = {X | X is an odd integer less than 10}
O = {X | X ∊ ℕ ⋀ x < 10 ⋀ x % 2 == 1 }
```

This works kind of like types in the way that you can specify something like `keyof {{interface}} and string` and through that typing we can determine the values in the set.

- A predicate may be used for succinctness
	- (where a predicate is basically a logical statement that can be True or False, depending on some variable(s).)

```python
𝑆 = {𝑥 | 𝑃(𝑥)}

# | can be read as “such that”
# ∈ can be read as “belongs to” 
# 𝑷(𝒙) here means 𝑃 is a predicate that is True for 𝑥
```

Example: 
- Example: `𝑆 = {𝑥 | 𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑚𝑒(𝑥)}`
- Example: Set of positive rational numbers: 
	`ℚ+ = {𝑥 ∈ ℝ | 𝑥 = 𝑝/𝑞, for some positive integers 𝑝, 𝑞}`

### Predicates
 A predicate is sometimes used to indicate set membership, a predicate F(x) will be true or false, depending on whether x belongs to a set.

**An example** 
- {x | x is a positive integer less than 4} is the set {1,2,3} 
- If t is an element of the set {x | F(x)}
- then the statement F(t) is true
- So if F(x) is defined as x % 2 = 0
- {x|F (x)} contains….the set of all even numbers 17 

Here, F(x) is referred to as the predicate, and x the subject of the proposition

### Graphical Representations
Sets can be represented graphically using Venn diagrams 

- The universal set U (which contains all of the objects under consideration) is represented by a rectangle
- Inside the rectangle, circles are used to represent sets 
- Sometimes points are used to represent the particular elements of the set

## The Power Set
Given a set S, the power set is the set of all subsets of the set S, denoted by:
$$P(S)$$
e.g. the power set of {0,1,2} is 

$$P(\{0,1,2\}) = \{\emptyset, \{0\}, \{1\}, \{2\}, \{0,1\}, \{0,2\}, \{1,2\}, \{0,1,2\} \}$$

- NB - the empty set and the set itself are members of this set of subsets
- If a set has n elements, its power set has 2n elements
- The power set does not contain numbers, it contains SETs

## Set Operations
***This is a lot of duplication from PA [[Software Engineering/Year 2/Practical Algorithms/Units/3. Data Collections/3.3 Sets]], If you are looking over might be better to take a look there.***

Two sets can be combined in many different ways
- The following illustrates some such combinations


- **Definition**: The union of the sets 𝐴 and 𝐵, denoted by 𝐴 ∪ 𝐵, is the set: 

```
{x|x ∈ A ∨ x ∈ B} # Analogous to the logical OR
```

- **Example**: What is {1, 2, 3} ∪ {3, 4, 5} ? 
- **Answer**: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

![[image18.png]]

### Intersection
- **Definition**: The intersection of sets A and B, denoted by A ∩ B, is:

```
{x|x ∈ A ^ x ∈ B} # Analogous to the logical AND
```

- ***Note: if the intersection 𝐴 ∩ 𝐵 is empty, then sets 𝐴 and 𝐵 are said to be disjoint.*** 

- **Example**: What is {1, 2, 3} ∩ {3, 4, 5} ?
	- **Answer**: {3}

- **Example**: What is {1, 2, 3} ∩ {4 , 5, 6} ? 
	- **Answer**: ∅ 

![[image19.png]]

### Complement
- **Definition**: the complement of 𝐴 (with respect to a given universal set 𝑈), denoted by Ā (or 𝐴𝑐) is the set: 

```
Ā = 𝑥 ∈ 𝑈 𝑥 ∉ 𝐴} # Analogous to the logical NOT
```

- **Example**: If 𝑈 is the positive integers less than 100, what is the complement of {𝑥 | 𝑥 > 70} ? Answer: {1, 2, … , 70} ?

```
Negation with: x<=70
```

- **Answer**: {1, 2, …, 70}

![[image20.png]]

### Difference
- Definition: The difference of 𝐴 from 𝐵, denoted by 𝐴 – 𝐵 (or 𝐴 ∖ 𝐵), is the set containing the all elements of 𝐴 that are not in 𝐵.

```
𝐴 − B = {𝑥 | 𝑥 ∈ 𝐴 ∧ 𝑥 ∉ 𝐵} = 𝐴 ∩ Ḃ
```

- 𝐴 − 𝐵 is also called the complement of B with respect to A

![[image21.png]]

**Example**: If `A={1,2,3}` and `B={3,4,5}`, then:

$$A - B = \{1, 2\}$$

### Symmetric Difference
- Definition: The *symmetric difference* of two sets A and B, denoted by A△B (or sometimes A⊕B), is the set of elements that are in either A or B but *not in both*.

This means that symmetric difference contains elements that are unique to each set and excludes any elements that are shared between A and B.

**Formula**:
$$A \triangle B = (A - B) $$

 **Example**: If `A={1,2,3}` and `B={3,4,5}`, then:
 $$A \triangle B = \{1, 2, 4, 5\}$$

# So why the Fuck Are We Doing This Againnn????

Well there's two ways of querying a database:
- **procedural** (relational algebra, Pandas)
	- Queries involve a *specific sequence of steps* to retrieve data.
	- The focus is on *how* to get data, specifying each operation.
	- Operations include loops, conditions, and transformations that control data retrieval and modification.
- **Example**
	Imagine a query that needs to retrieve all records where `age > 30`:
	
	In a procedural approach, this would likely be done by looping through each record, checking the age, and then selecting the ones that match.
	
- **declarative** (SQL)
	- Relies on *declarative queries*, where you state what result you want, not how to get it.
	- Uses mathematical operations (like joins, unions, and intersections) to generate results.
	- Emphasizes *what* to retrieve, with less concern about the steps taken.

#### A Relational Instance
This Student relation instance has:
- Degree 4 and Cardinality 3

A relation is a set of tuples (or n-tuples) 
- As each tuple has n values (same as degree of the relation)
- E.g. <Fraser,880123,50,65> is a 4-tuple.

#### N-tuples Are not Sets
The order of elements in a collection is sometimes important
- But sets are unordered, so a different structure is needed

This is provided by ordered n-tuples
- <2,1,5> is an 3-tuple
Two ordered n-tuples are equal if and only if each corresponding pair of their elements is equal
- <a1,a2,….an> = <b1,b2,…..bn> if and only if ai=bi for i=1,2,…n

- {1, 3, 5} = {3, 1, 5} = TRUE for SETS
- <1, 3, 5> = <3, 1, 5> = FALSE for N-TUPLES


#### Cartesian Product
***A key point here that isn't mentioned is this is the background operation for an equi-join in sql.***

Let A and B be sets

The cartesian product of A and B (A X B) is 
- the set of all ordered pairs (i.e. tuples) <a,b> where a ∈ A and b ∈ B
- A={0,1}, B={a,b,c} 
- A X B = {<0,a>,<0,b>,<0,c>, <1,a>, <1,b> ,<1,c>}
