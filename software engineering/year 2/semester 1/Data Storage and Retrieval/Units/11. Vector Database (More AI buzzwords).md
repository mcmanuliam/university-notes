# Introduction

The information needs of users that relational and NoSQL databases are from structured data:
- Tell me the average salary of each studio
- Each studio has a salary
- There is a correct answer for every query

Some information needs are much more vague:
- Find me documents about the SQL GROUP BY statement
- Which is the best nearby pub

## Information Retrieval

IR systems find information in data (e.g. large collections of documents) that are unstructured (e.g. plain text) to satisfy an information need that is stated in the form of an inexact query.

### What is a Document?

Example types of documents include: 
- web pages, email, books, news stories, scholarly papers, text messages, Word documents, PPT, PDF, forum postings, patents, etc. 
- Can also include images, descriptions of images, audio etc. 

Documents are typically made up mostly of unstructured text. However, documents usually have some structured components, e.g: 
- title, author, subject, HTML tags, sender, destination, etc.

### Text Matching

Comparing the query text to the text of the documents in the collection to determine the best match is the core functionality of an IR System. 

However, exact term matching is not enough: 
- There are lots of different ways to write the same thing in natural language, e.g. English 
- Does a news story containing the text "COVID-19 vaccine stimulates an immune response" match the query? 
	- Possibly!

# A Vector Databases Enables?

- Fast, scalable similarity search across millions or billions of vectors.
- Integration with AI/ML pipelines for real-time recommendations and decision-making.
- Enhanced storage and retrieval of unstructured, multidimensional data.

# Vector Space Model

The Vector Space Model (VSM) is a mathematical framework used to represent data as vectors in a multi-dimensional space.

- Each piece of data (e.g., a word, document, or image) is represented as a point in a high-dimensional vector space.
- Relationships between data points are quantified using mathematical metrics such as cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, or the dot product of two vectors.

Learned vector representations can capture the semantics of the data within the vector space.

Queen = [0.3,0.9] 
King = [0.5,0.7] 
Woman = [0.3,0.4] 
Man = [0.5,0.2] 

Queen – Woman + Man = King

Vector similarity search enables the finding of data points (vectors) in the high-dimensional space that are the most similar to a given query vector. 

- At the core of similarity search are vector are vector similarity measures, such as: 
	
	- Cosine Similarity (angle between vectors).
	- Euclidean Distance (straight-line distance). 
	- Dot Product (magnitude-based similarity).
	
- Such measures are often implemented as part of an (approximate) nearest neighbor search algorithm
