# `stdin`, `stdout`, `stderr`

- Linux standard streams
- `stdin` 0 - The default source of data, usually the keyboard
- `stdout` 1 - The default destination of output, usually the screen
- `stderr` 2 - The default destination for error messages, usually the screen
- These can all be redirected

# `printf() and scanf()`

- Part of the standard ANSI C library
- Are the most versatile means of communicating with programs.
- Both work in similar ways

## `scanf`

- Reads data from keyboard according to a specified format.
- Assigns to given variable

```c
int v;
float rate;
scanf("%d", &v); // Reads int from input and assigns to variable v
scanf("%f", &rate); // Reads floating-point value from the keyboard
```

## `fgetc() and fputc()`

- Reads the next character from a given input stream.
	- On success, returns a character as an unsigned char converted to an int
	- On fail, returns EOF
	
- Can be redirected to other streams 
	- e.g. a file using `fopen()`

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void) {
	int f = fgetc(stdin);
	if (fgetc(stdin) == 0) {
		printf("Invalid Input!");
		return 1;
	}
	printf("You have entered %c\n", f);
}
```

# `puts()` And `gets()`

- Used to display text messages on the screen 
- But it can not display numeric variables 
	- limited capability, but less overhead
	
- puts 
	- takes a single string as its argument and displays it 
	- it automatically adds a newline at the end 

- gets 
	- reads a line from stdin 
	- stores it in the string pointed to
