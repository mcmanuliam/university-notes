# Stack vs. Heap Memory Regions

- So far we have only been using variables with auto memory allocation
	- all managed throughout lifetime by the compiler.

- These variables are stored in the stack part of the memory.
	- The size of each variable has to be know and be statically.

- In many cases we don't know the size of variables before running.
	- Imagine arrays.

- For such cases we manage memory manually by dynamically requesting and freeing memory.

- The part of memory used for dynamic allocation is called the heap
	- It's usually seen as unorganised and is all user managed.
	
- The stack and the heap share the same address space and grow with use towards each other.

# Memory Allocation Functions
## `malloc` (Memory Allocation)

**Function**:

```c
void *malloc(size_t size);
```

- **Purpose**: Allocates a block of memory of the specified size (in bytes) on the heap.

- **Behavior**:
    - On success, it returns a void pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block.
    - The allocated memory **is not initialized**; it may contain garbage values.
    - If the allocation fails (e.g., insufficient memory), it returns `NULL`.
    
- **Usage**:
    - Suitable for allocating a single block of uninitialized memory when you don't need initialization to zero.
    - Example:

```c
// Allocates space for 5 integers.
int *arr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));

if (arr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
}

```
        
- Commonly used in cases where memory initialization isn't immediately needed, but speed is important.

## `calloc` (Contiguous Allocation)

**Function**:

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size);
```

- **Purpose**: Allocates memory for an array of `num` objects, each of size `size`, and initializes all bits in the allocated memory to zero.

- **Behavior**:
    - On success, it returns a void pointer to the first byte of the allocated memory block.
    - All the allocated memory is initialized to zero.
    - If allocation fails, it returns `NULL`.
    
- **Usage**:
    - Suitable when you need memory initialized to zero.
    - Commonly used when working with arrays where zero-initialization is critical to avoid undefined behavior.

**Example**:
        
```c
// Initial allocation.
int *arr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));

 // Resize to hold 10 integers.
arr = (int *)realloc(arr, 10 * sizeof(int));

if (arr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory reallocation failed\n");
}
```

- Ensures efficient memory usage as data requirements change during program execution.

## `realloc` (Reallocation)

**Function**:

```c
void *realloc(void *ptr, size_t new_size);

```

- **Purpose**: Changes the size of an already allocated memory block pointed to by `ptr` to `new_size`.

- **Behavior**:
    - If `ptr` is `NULL`, it behaves like `malloc(new_size)`.
    - If `new_size` is 0, it behaves like `free(ptr)` and returns `NULL`.
    - It tries to extend or shrink the memory block in place if possible.
    - If the existing block cannot accommodate the new size, it allocates a new block of the desired size, copies the existing data to the new block, and frees the old block.
    
- **Usage**:
    - Useful for resizing arrays or data structures dynamically.
    - Example:
        
```c
// Initial allocation.
int *arr = (int *)malloc(5 * sizeof(int));

// Resize to hold 10 integers.
arr = (int *)realloc(arr, 10 * sizeof(int));

if (arr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory reallocation failed\n");
}
```
        
- Ensures efficient memory usage as data requirements change during program execution.

## Use Cases
| **Function**  | **Use Case**                                                           |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **`malloc`**  | When you need uninitialized memory quickly.                            |
| **`calloc`**  | When you need memory initialized to zero (e.g., for arrays).           |
| **`realloc`** | When you need to resize an already allocated memory block dynamically. |
## Best Practices

1. **Always check for `NULL`**: Verify that `malloc`, `calloc`, or `realloc` did not return `NULL` before using the pointer

2. **Free memory**: Use `void free(void *ptr)` to release memory back to the heap when it's no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.

3. **Use `calloc` for initialization**: Prefer `calloc` if the allocated memory needs to be zero-initialized to avoid undefined behavior.

4.  **Set a pointer to NULL after freeing it**, it makes it easy to check if you have free'd it or not.

# Examples

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main() {
    int* ptr = NULL;
    printf("Value of ptr (uninitialized): %p\n", (void*)ptr);

    ptr = (int*) malloc(sizeof(int));
    if (!ptr) {
        fprintf(stderr, "Memory allocation failed\n");
        return 1;
    }
    
    printf("Value of ptr (initialized): %p\n", (void*)ptr);

    *ptr = 12;
    printf("Value stored at ptr: %d\n", *ptr);

    free(ptr);
    printf("Value of ptr after free (dangling pointer): %p\n", (void*)ptr);
    ptr = NULL;
    printf("Value of ptr after nulling: %p\n", (void*)ptr);

    return 0;
}
```
