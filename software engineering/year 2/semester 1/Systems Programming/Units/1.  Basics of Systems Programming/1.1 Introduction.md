# What is Systems Programming?

- **Computer Systems Software**
	- A platform for other software; scaffolding; a layer of abstraction
		- i.e. the main 'customer' is other software, not necessarily users
		- In contrast to application software
		- Examples: OS's, drivers, compilers and utilities

- System software typically operates under specific performance requirements such as:
	- Fast exec time
	- Low memory consumption
	- Low energy usage
	
- To meet these requirements we use systems languages, one of these is C ([[0.1 Idiots Guide to C]])


# History of Systems Programming

- Until the 1970s
	- Systems software was generally written in processor-specific assembly languages.
		- Mostly based on ALGO60 concepts
	- Very difficult to write and maintain.
	
- 1972
	- Ritchie and Thomas wanted to port UNIX from the DEC PDP-7 to the PDP-11 
	- They looked for a portable programming language (tried their B type-less language)
	- Invented C as an imperative language supporting structured programming

- 1983
	- due to its popularity, C had numerous variants
	- ANSI defined standard versions: C85, C99, C11, â€¦ 

- early 1980s 
	- Bjarne Stroustrup aimed to enrich C with new abstraction mechanisms 
	- Inspired by Simula, the first object-oriented language, he creates C++ 
		- Simula is a superset of ALGOL 60 
	
- 2010s New systems programming languages 
	- e.g. Rust (2010) and Swift (2014)

# Why Systems Language?
## A Simple Python Program

```python
import sys

x = 41
x = x + 1

print(sys.getsizeof(x))
```

**Q: What value does x hold at the end of the program execution?** 
- (not a tricky question) 
- A: 42 

**Q: How much memory does Python take to store x?** 
- (a tricky question) 
- A: It depends on the Python implementation. 
- `sys.getsizeof(x)` gets the answer. On my machine: 16 bytes

**Q: How many instructions does Python execute to compute x+1?** 
- (even more tricky)
- A: I don't know, but many more than just the addition â€¦ Python is dynamically typed, so the data type of x could change at any time. Every operation tests the data types of the operands to check which instruction to execute

## A Simple C Program

```c
int main() {
	int x = 41;
	x = x + 1
}
```

**Q: What value does x have at the end of the program execution?**
- (not a tricky question) 
- A: 42 

**Q: How much memory does C take to store x?** 
- (not that tricky)
- A: sizeof(int) usually 4 bytes

**Q: How many instructions does C take to compute x+1?** 
- (not that tricky)
- A: 1 add instruction and 2 memory (mov) instructions

# Why C?

- Versatile 
	- Whole OS, compilers, networking, games, word processors, web apps, â€¦ 
- Portable (thanks to ANSI/ISO standards) 
	- Can be compiled and run on different platforms with no modification
- Systems with constrained resources 
	- Small number of keywords (32) o Modular Â§ code reuse through functions and structures o Builds understanding of resource management Â§ important for becoming a better developer

# Development Cycle

# Compilers
 
 - You understand your C code (I hope!) (Probably not)
 - Your computer does not; it only understands machine language
 - A compiler translates from source code to object code 
 - There are many C compilers, around 50 or so 
	 - Borland Turbo C (1987) 
	 - GNU Compiler Collection, GCC (1987) 
	 - Tiny C (2005) 
	 - Clang (2007) <- You use this

- To compile and then execute a C program: 
	- Translating source code into machine code is a multi-step process: 
		1. The preprocessor expands macros 
		2. In the compiling stage, the source code is
			- a) parsed and turned into an intermediate representation 
			- b) machine-specific assembly code is generated 
			- c) machine code is generated in an object file 
		3. The linker combines multiple object files into an executable
	
- We will peek into each of these with examples

## Preprocessing
Input program as C source code.

**Input**

```c
#include <studio.h>

int main() {
	int x = 41;
	x = x + 1;
	printf("%d \n", x);
}
```

**Output**

```c
typedef signed char __int8_t;
typedef unsigned char __uint8_t;
// ...
int printf(const char * restrict, ...)
// ...
int main() {
	int x = 41;
	x = x + 1;
	printf("%d \n", x);
}
```

**You can generate this code after the preprocessor stage with the -E flag:**

```bash
clang source.c -E -o source.e
```

## Compiler Intermediate Representation

**Program after Processing**

```c
typedef signed char __int8_t;
typedef unsigned char __uint8_t;
// ...
int printf(const char * restrict, ...)
// ...
int main() {
	int x = 41;
	x = x + 1;
	printf("%d \n", x);
}
```

**Program in compiler intermediate representation**

![[Pasted image 20241125150605.png]]

**You can generate the intermediate representation with the -emit-llvm -S flags:**

```bash
clang source.c -emit-llvm -S -o source.llvm
```

## Assembly Code

**Program in compiler intermediate representation**

**Program in machine-specific assembly code (here for x86-64**)

![[Pasted image 20241125150821.png]]

**You can generate the assembly code with the -S flag:**

```bash
clang source.c -S -o sourec.s
```

## Machine Code

**Program in machine-specific assembly code (here for x86-64)**

![[Pasted image 20241125150821.png]]

**Program in machine code.**

![[Pasted image 20241125150951.png]]

**You can generate an object file with machine code using the -c flag.**

```bash
clang source.c -c -o source.o
```

## Linking

- The linker combines one or more object files into a single executable 
- The linker checks that all functions called in the program have machine code available 
	- e.g. printf's machine code is in the C standard library

# The Basics
## The main() Function

- The only one required for any C program 
- It denotes the entry point to the program 
	- there can only be one and exactly one 

- It returns an int to signify the exit code
	- 0 = normal execution and termination, i.e. at last statement in main 
	- Non Zero Exit Code = abnormal termination 
	- if no return statement, an implicit return 0 is executed

- **It's good practice to always return 0 if a function executes successfully.**

## Basic Output with Printf

- Defined in `<stdio.h>`, it allows the formatted printing of values
	- The first argument is the format string (using special characters) 
	- The second argument onwards are the values to be printed 
	- The number and order of format strings and values have to match

| Special Characters     | Explanation                                     | Argument Type      |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| `%c`                   | Single Character                                | `char`             |
| `%s`                   | Character String                                | `String: (char *)` |
| `%d`                   | Signed integer in decimal                       | `int`              |
| `%l` or `%ld` or `%li` | Long                                            | `long`             |
| `%f`                   | Floating point number in decimal representation | `float double`     |

**Task 1.A**
- Setup Shiz

**Task 1.B**
- Write a program that uses `printf()` to print your first and last names on one line, followed by your favourite past time activity on the following line.
- Modify the program to also convert your age in years to days and displays both values. You do not need to worry about fractional and leap years. For example, if your age is 20 years, the program should print "20 years = 7300 days".

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
	printf("%s \n", "Liam McManus");
	printf("%s \n", "Games n that (rn Pokemon been fun)");
    
    int age = 18;
    int ageInDays = age * 365;
    printf("%d = %d \n", age, ageInDays);
	return 0;
}
```


**Task 1.C** 
- Download the Fibonacci program from Moodle. 
- Generate all the different representations that were discussed in the lecture, from pre-processing to object code

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  int x = 34;

  long xnow = 0;
  long xnext = 1;

  while (x > 1) {
    int xtmp = xnow + xnext;
    xnow = xnext;
    xnext = xtmp;
    x = x - 1;
  }

  printf("fib(%d) = %ld\n", x, xnext);

  return 0;
}
```
