- Software development is not free of errors 
- We call these bugs 
	- syntactical – grammar => compiler 
	- semantic – meaning => you 
	
- We will catalog a number of tools to help identify and understand bugs 
	- Debuggers: run a program in a controlled environment to investigate its execution 
	- Static analysis tools: reason about a program's behaviour without running it
	- Dynamic analysis tools: add instructions to a program to detect bugs at runtime
# Segmentation Fault

- This is one of the most common runtime errors in C systems

- It's raised by the OS and notifies you the program is doing something it shouldn't be doing, really just attempting to access a restricted area of memory

- This will be raised by:
	- Dangling Pointer, a pointer to memory which has been de-allocated then allocated to another variable.
	- If you NULL after freeing it's easier to check if this pointer is active.
	
- Dereferencing a NUL pointer
	- NULL isn't valid space in memory.

- Buffer Overflow
	- Accessing memory outside of allocated bounds, typically with arrays imagine allocating Array[5] and trying to access array[6]
	- You can read the values in these extra locations but the data would be corrupted.
	
- Stack Overflow
	- Trying to write more memory than allocated
	- Often triggered by recursion without base case.

- Heap Overflow (Remember this is manually allocated)
	- Memory Leaks
