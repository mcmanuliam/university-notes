# Ideas

- `Idea #1` - Let's use special registers to store the first and last address in a process's address space (Base Register & Limit Register) 

- `Idea #2` - Partition RAM into fixed size partitions, allocate one to each running process • Would work, but is inflexible and clunky 
	- Creates internal fragmentation: space within partitions of some processes goes unused 

- `Idea #3` - Variable-sized partitions: 
	- The OS keeps track of lists of allocated and unallocated ranges in RAM 
	- When a new process arrives, it blocks until an unallocated range large enough to fit it is found 
	- If an unallocated range is too large, it is split into two parts: one allocated to the new process, one added to the list of unallocated ranges 
	- Can create external fragmentation: space in between partitions too small to be used 

- `Idea #4` Segments: Maintain several segments per process and a table with information for each segment (extension of BR/LR to "mini" address spaces) 
	- … but how to map segments to unallocated ranges in RAM

# Paging

- Partition address space in equally sized, fixed-size partitions.
	- Size always a power of 2 -- i.e., 2^d
	- Typical page sizes: 1KB - 4KB (could get even bigger in modern OS)
	- Each page is kept on disk so there can be a lot of them
	
- A location in the address space can be given as either an address, or a page number plus an offset within set page

## Example

- Assume we have a main memory of 32 bytes and 4-byte frames → we need 8 frames and an offset with 2 bits (d = 2) 

- Assume our process's address space (i.e. logical memory) is 16 bytes large and 4-byte pages → we need at least 4 distinct page numbers

# Allocation of Frames

- Each process needs a minimum number of frames 
	- Maximum is the total frames in the system, minus frames allocated to the OS 

- **Three major allocation schemes**: 

	- Fixed allocation 
		- Divide available frames equally among processes 
		
	- Proportional allocation 
		- Give each process a percentage of frames equal to its size divided by the sum of sizes of all processes 
		
	- Priority allocation 
		- Like proportional allocation, but taking into account the priority of a process (possibly in combination with its sized

# Performance Considerations

- The page table is an Operating System construct but with hardware assistance… 
- The page table is kept in main memory 
- Page-table base register (PTBR) points to the beginning of page table location 
- Page-table length register (PTLR) indicates the size of the page table 

- But wait! In this addressing scheme, every data/instruction access requires two memory accesses! 
- One for the page table entry and one for the actual data/instruction 
- **How is this acceptable ????**#

# Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)

- **Caching** to the rescue: there is the Translation Lookaside Buffer, an on-CPU hardware cache for page table entries.

# Shared Pages

- Pages may be shared across processes
	- Often done for pages containing code

- Remember fork?

- Can we make it any faster?… **Yes**, with Copy-on-Write 
	- Both processes share the same pages in memory 
	- Only when a process tries to modify a page, a private copy is created

# Demand Paging

- Remember
	- Each page is kept on disk, so there can be a lot of them.
	- Paging means moving a page/frame of data from disk to memory or vice-versa 
	- Initially, all pages are on disk (e.g., before executing a program)

- What if a process tries to access a page that is not loaded in RAM?

- This leads to a Page fault and the pager (a.k.a. page fault handler of the memory management unit) kicks in 

1. Trap to the operating system (original process is blocked) 
2. Pager computes page location on disk and issues a disk read request to load page contents
3. Another process executes 
4. Interrupt from the disk (I/O completed): Control passed to the pager again, which updates the page table, unblocking the original process 
5. Pager returns to the process scheduler (which selects some process)

# Page Replacement

- Normally, most or all of the page frames are in use 
- In this case, when a page fault occurs, it is not possible to simply read the page into an empty frame

- The system must:
	1. Select a full frame (page replacement algorithm) 
	2. Write its contents to disk (page-out) 
	3. Then read the required page into this frame (page-in)
	
- In practice, it is better to keep empty frames ready 
	- On a page fault, the read (to load the data) can start immediately 
	- separate write (to clear another frame) can be done afterward
