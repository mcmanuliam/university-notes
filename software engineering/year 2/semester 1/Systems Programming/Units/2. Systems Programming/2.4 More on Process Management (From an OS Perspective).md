# Recap: Life of a Process

- Pretty much a diagram, you will already remember this from **CANS**

- A process can be CPU bound meaning we are waiting for processing or I/O bound which means we are waiting for a user interaction or an output.

- The information associated with each process is as follows:

# Process Creation

- Parent process creates child processes
	- A "process tree" captures parent-child relations
	- `fork(2)`, `exec(3)`, `wait(2)`

- Exec options 
	- Parent and child exec concurrently - Async
	- Parent waits for children to terminate - Sync

# Fork, Exec, and Wait on a Unix-alike System in C

```c
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main() {
	pid_t pid; 
	
	/* fork a child process */
	pid = fork(); 
	
	if (pid < 0) { /* error occurred */
		fprintf(stderr, "Fork Failed"); 
		return 1; 
	} else if (pid == 0) { /* child process */
		execlp("/bin/ls", "ls", NULL);
	} else { /* parent process */
		/* parent will wait for the child to complete */ 
		wait(NULL); 
		printf("Child Complete"); 
	}
	return 0;
}
```

# Process Scheduling

- (CPU-) Scheduling's main goal: Maximize CPU utilization

- Several queues of processes need to be maintained:
	- **Job queue** all process in the system
	- **Ready queue** processes in memory and ready to exec
	- **Devices queue** process waiting on devices
	
- Processes will migrate between all these various queues.

# CPU Scheduler

- CPU scheduling decisions may take place when a process:

1. Switches from running to waiting
2. Switches from running to ready
3. Switches from waiting to ready
4. Terminates

- **Non-preemtive scheduling**: Let the process give up the CPU (1 and 4)

- **Preemtive scheduling**: The Scheduler decides when a process yields the CPU (all cases)

# Dispatcher
The **Dispatcher** is a critical component in an operating system responsible for managing the CPU's execution of processes. 

- Gives control of the CPU to the process selected
- Needs to:
	- Switch context (load registers, PCB, etc.)
	- Switch to user mode
	- Jump to the right instruction in the program to continue.

- Latency???
	- Note: Context switch is pure overhead - add to during lecture.

- Investigate which tools allow you to see running processes on your OS 
	- Which process is using the most memory and which the most CPU? Disk I/O? Network? 
	- How many threads does a specific process have? Which user started a process? Which process has been running for the longest time? 

- How can you find a specific process? `PiD`

- Can you stop/kill a specific process while it runs? Yes
	- Note: Please only try this, if you know it's fine to stop a particular process
