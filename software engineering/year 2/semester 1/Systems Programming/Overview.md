# Intending Learning Outcomes
Develop an understanding of the following:

- Behavior of low-level programs written in c
- Representation of data structures
- Manual Memory Management
- The impact of memory utilization, caching, virtual memory and other low level system details.
- Concurrency, Race Conditions

# Why???
First, note the ILOs doesn't mention C
- This is not a C tutorial, but a System Programming Course

So, why systems programming?
- Knowledge required to program systems software e.g. basic systems like OS's, DB's, ML Systems, IoT systems.
- Skills are expected for many industry research roles.

More motivation in each of out first lectures.
