From this list I've got a few key ones sticking out to me, there's more than four so I'm gonna need to cut this down at some point:

- **Machine Learning** ([COMPSCI4061](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI4061))
	- Gonna need it, no matter what I go into this is gonna be a big factor, I don't think I should pick both AI and ML, out of these two I would go for this.
	
- **Dist and Parallel Tech** ([COMPSCI4082](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI4082))
	- Thinking this ones a lead on from Systems Programming, will be a really nice one to get into, especially with Constraints Programming I'd have a really good idea of Coding really efficiently.
	
- **Constraints Programming** ([COMPSCI5006](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI5006))
	- Another one continuing on from Systems Programming, I really enjoyed the memory requirements from SP, thinking continuing into that part of the field could lead me to some really cool things.

- **Computational Game Theory** ([COMPSCI5116](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI5116))
	- I've looked into this before, the idea of split of steal, selfish models vs fair models etc. I can't see it having too much of a relation to the actual work I'll be doing but I think it would be a really interesting one to look into.

- **Modelling Reactive Systems** ([COMPSCI4031](https://www.gla.ac.uk/coursecatalogue/course/?code=COMPSCI4031))
	- Another one continuing on from Systems, this one looks like it's wide stretching and could actually be used in my job.
