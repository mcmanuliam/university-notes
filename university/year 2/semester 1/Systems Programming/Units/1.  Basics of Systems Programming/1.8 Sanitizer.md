# Static Analysis

- A static analyzer reasons about the code without executing it 
- The compiler performs some static analysis every time you compile code 
	- e.g. type checking 
	
- It is good practice to enable all warnings and make warnings errors 
	- `i.e. use the flags -Wall -Werror`
	- so the compiler can be most helpful in detecting bugs before execution 
- Some static analysis is too expensive to perform in every build 
- Other static analysis enforces a particular coding guideline 
- We invoke the static analyzer using a flag and specifying the output format of the report:

```
clang --analyze --analyzer-output html program.
```

# `clang-tidy`

- A linter (the name comes from the first UNIX tool to perform static analysis on C) 
- clang-tidy is a flexible tool that allows to enforce coding guidelines and to modernize source code 
	- It is possible to extend clang-tidy by writing your own checks (Think about your own linter.)

- It is invoked like clang, accepting the same flags but after two dashes: 
	- A series of checks can be enabled / disabled 
	- Detailed information is available at: <http://clang.llvm.org/extra/clang-tidy/>

# Dynamic Analysis Tools

- There exists a family of bug detection tools that use dynamic analysis 
- These tools need the program to run and can only detect bugs which are encountered during the execution of a particular test input 

- The clang project calls these tools sanitizers. The most important are: 
	- `AddressSanitizer` - a memory error detector 
	- `MemorySanitizer` - a detector of uninitialized reads 
	- `LeakSanitizer` - a memory leak detector 
	- `UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer` - a detector of undefined behavior 
	
- Later in the course, you might want to look up: 
	- `ThreadSanitizer` - a data race detector

## Address Sanitizer

 - Address Sanitizer is a memory error detector for: 
	 - Out-of-bounds / Use-after-free / Double free memory accesses 
	 
- Makes clang insert instructions to monitor every memory access 
	- This slows down the execution by about 2x 
	- valgrind (a similar tool) has often a slowdown of 20-100x!
	
- These flags enable address sanitizer: 

```
clang -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer -O1 -g -Wall -Werror program.c -o program
``` 

- fno-omit-frame-pointer produces a readable call stack 
- 01 enables basic optimizations 
- The compiler will produce a binary as usual: `./program` 
- Address Sanitizer has found hundreds of [bugs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerFoundBugs) in large scale software projects ยง e.g. Chromium and Firefox

## Memory Sanitizer

- Detects uninitialized reads to memory 
- Under active development 
- Currently only available for Linux and BSD
- Leak sanitizer detects memory leaks (i.e. un-free'd memory blocks)

## Undefined Behavior

- For certain operations, the C standard demands no particular behavior 
	- typically cases that are considered bugs, e.g. dereferencing a null pointer 

- It is expensive to check if dereferencing a pointer is valid every time 
- Because the compiler does not have to ensure a particular behavior for null pointers, it assumes that the programmer checked that the pointer is not null 
- Undefined behavior is therefore crucial for fast code, but makes detection of bugs much harder, as it is not guaranteed that a bug will result in a crash 
- A good introduction to undefined behavior is this series of blog post - <https://blog.llvm.org/2011/05/what-every-c-programmer-should-know.html>.

### Undefined Behavior Sanitizer

- Detects various types of undefined behavior
- This will detect the integer overflow here.

```c
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
	int k = 0x7fffffff; // this is the largest possible signed int value ... 
	k += argc; // ... this will produce an integer overflow
	return 0;
} 

// clang -fsanitize=undefined -Wall -Werror intOverflow.c -o file

// file.c:3:5: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 2147483647 + 1 cannot be represented in type 'int
```
