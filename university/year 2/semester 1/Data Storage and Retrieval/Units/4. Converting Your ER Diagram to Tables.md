Translating E-R to Relational Schema

1. Entities and their simple attributes
2. Weak entities and their simple attributes
3. 1-M relationships (and their attribute)
4. 1-1 relationships (and their attributes)
5. M-N relationships (and their attributes)
6. Composite attributes
7. Multivalued attributes

## ER to Schemas

#### Strong Entity Types
For each strong entity type, create a relation (table) with:
- A **column** for each simple attribute
	- composite attributes - broken into several columns 
- A **primary key** – one or more of the candidate key attributes

Multi Attribute **Address**:

| Name | NINumber | DoB | Address_House | Address_Street | Address_City |
| ---- | -------- | --- | ------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
|      |          |     |               |                |              |

***Good Practice: Use the name of the composite attribute as a prefix for each of the component names***
#### A Column of a relation is an Attribute Having:
- a name (indicates the role the column has in this relation)
- a domain (indicates the set of values it may take) 

```
Student_ID_Number: INT, 
address: VARCHAR(100), 
dateOfBirth: DATE
```

#### Primary Keys
Another Example: 
`Employee (name: VARCHAR(20) ,NI_no: INT)` 
`Project (p_name: VARCHAR(20), P_ID: INT)` 

- particular staff record can be identified as: the record in the Employee table where NI_No= 9912345
- a particular project record can be identified as: the record in the Project table where P_ID= 125 • all of the record's other data will be accessed via these 'keys'
- i.e. given a key value, we can determine everything else about the corresponding record

#### Movies ER
![[image2.png]]

```
Movie(Title, Type)
Stars(Name, Address)
Studio(Name, Address)
```

#### The Relational Model
- A Movie has a Release
- In the relational database
- How does each member of the Release entity set know which Movie they are related to? This is done via KEYS.
	- Primary 
	- Foreign: references to the primary key of another table

#### Weak Entities Mapping
Create primary key for a weak entity type from
- primary key attributes of the identifying relationship types
- partial keys of the weak entity
- Rule: For each weak entity
	- create a new relation schema
	- for each identifying relationship: add the key attributes of the related entity to the new schema as foreign key attributes
	- declare the composite primary key of the schema
	- add the simple attributes

#### Foreign Keys: Definition
The foreign key is used to cross-reference between tables (Just create a link)
- Definition: A foreign key is an attribute (or set of attributes) that exist in one or more tables and which is the primary key for one of those tables.
- The foreign key restricts the domain of the attribute
- A value in a foreign key MUST exist in the referenced primary key attribute

#### Using Foreign Keys
A foreign key is a referential constraint between two tables, i.e. a value in a foreign key MUST exist in the referenced primary key
- A table may have multiple foreign keys and each foreign key can reference a different table
- Foreign keys need not have the same attribute name across tables
- Could have been Release(MovieTitle, Year, Length)
- Names should differ to help readability!
- The MUST have the same data type
- Foreign keys are important in modelling weak entities and relationships.

There are only two ways of connecting two related pieces of data in a relational database
1. They are in the same tuple (row) of the same table, i.e. with the same primary key value
2. "Jane" and "Jones" are connected since they are in the same record
3. They are in tuples which are connected by a foreign key or a chain of foreign keys
4. "Jones" and "Cooper" are connected by the foreign key, adviser
## Back to the ER Diagram: Relations - Entities
What do we have thus far?

```
Movie(Title : VARCHAR(50), 
Type : VARCHAR(20)) 
Release(Title : VARCHAR(50), 
Year : INT, Length : INT)
Stars(Name : VARCHAR(50), 
Address : VARCHAR(50)) 
Studio(Name : VARCHAR(50), 
Address : VARCHAR(50))
```

***Notes:*** 
- ***each table has primary key attribute(s)***
- ***Release's Title is a foreign key reference to Movie's Title***

Hey Man, looks like I am your uni buddy. Usually, people set up in-person meetings, but I’m not sure if we need to do that, it's up to you though. Feel free to message me with any questions you have. If you're struggling with anything, don't hesitate to send a message over! I’m much better at coding than theory.
```

### Relationships: 1-to-many

```
Movie(Title, Type)
Release(Title, Year, Length)
Stars(Name, Address)
Studio(Name, Address)
```

1-to-many rule: the primary key on the 'one side' of the relationship is added to the 'many side' as a foreign key.

![[image5.png]]

Move name as Studio as a foreign key to Stars and move salary to Stars.

```
Movie(Title, Type)
Release(Title, Year, Length)
Stars(Name, Address, Studio.Name as Studio, Salary)
Studio(Name, Address)
```

### Relationships: 1-to-many
Rule 1-1: For each one-to-one relationship type between two entity types, choose one entity type to be the subject and one to be the target type
- add the key attributes of the subject class to the target schema as foreign key attributes
- add the attributes of the relationship to the target schema

![[image6.png]]

***Under Rule 1-1, what is the best choice for "subject" and "target"?***

```
Staff(staffId, lastname, firstName)
School(Name, headOfSchool)
```

***You will need to set a not null constraint on the Foreign Key***

### Relationships: Many to Many (Mother Fucking Junction Table)

```
Movie(Title, Type, Studio, SequelOf)
Release(Title, Year, Length)
Stars(Name, Address, Studio , Salary)
Studio(Name, Address)
```

A new relation is produced which contains the primary keys from both sides of the relationship as foreign keys, These attributes form a composite primary key for the relation.
