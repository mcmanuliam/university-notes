# What is It???

- **What is NoSQL?**
	- The terminology is not used consistently.
	- No SQL, Not only SQL?â€¦
	
- It's not a definite term, it's was describe as a database that's not relational, then it was explained as a document based system, these are both false, I'd simple say it's just a database that doesn't use SQL
	
	- This can be a non relational system
	- Or document based.
	
- Generally thought of as an alternative when a relational database is a bad fit.

## Advantages of NoSQL

- **Performance**: 
	- Enterprises can increase performance with NoSQL databases by simply adding additional commodity resources. 
	- Enables organizations to deliver reliably fast user experiences with a predictable return on investment for the added resources.
	
- **Scalability** (This is the main driving force behind **NoSQL databases**):
	- NoSQL databases use horizontal scale-out to makes it easy to add or reduce capacity quickly and non-disruptively using commodity hardware. 
	- This eliminates the very large costs and complexity of manual *sharding* that is necessary when scaling relational DBMS.
	
- **Flexible Data Model**:
	- NoSQL provides application developers with more options to select solutions to match the data types and query options that are the most appropriate to their specific application use case, instead of being constrained by a single database schema

Some "distributed" NoSQL databases deploy a masterless architecture that automatically distributes data equally among multiple resources to ensure the availability of the data during failures
# Common Types of NoSQL

- **Main Types:**
	- **Key-value** stores
	- **Document** stores
	- **Wide Column** (column family, column oriented, â€¦) stores
	- **Graph** databases
	
- **Other types**: 
	- **Object** databases
	- Native **XML** databases 
	- **RDF** stores 
	- â€¦

## Key-Value Stores

The simplest NoSQL database type, essentially a simple hash table (mapping). It's essentially just a generic object, very efficient.

```typescript
type GenericObject<T> = {[key: string]: T};
```

 - Suitable use cases 
	 - Session data, user profiles, user preferences, shopping carts, â€¦ 
	 - i.e. when values are only accessed via keys
	 
- When not to use 
	- Relationships among entities 
	- Queries requiring access to the content of the value part 
	- Set operations involving multiple key-value pairs
 
## Document Stores (Mongo DB)

Typically stores self-describing documents organised into collections. It's just JSON objects. all documents are identified with a unique `_id`.

When not to use
- Set operations involving multiple documents
- If the document structure changes frequently

## Wide Column Store

Stores data in tables with rows and columns similar to the relational model, but: 
- The names and the formats of columns can vary across tables

Column family (table)
- collection of similar rows (not necessarily identical)

Row is a collection of columns
- Should encompass a group of data that is accessed together
- Associated with a unique row key

A column has a column name and column value (+metadata) 
- Scalar values, but also flat sets, lists or maps may be allowed

When not to use
- When **ACID** transactions are required 
- Complex queries: aggregation (**SUM**, **AVG**, â€¦), joining, â€¦

## Graph Databases
- [x] ðŸ”½ [Give **Neo4J** a try.](https://neo4j.com/) âœ… 2025-02-18

Graph databases use graph structures to store, map, and query relationships. 
- Directed or undirected graphs.

Collections of 
- Nodes (vertices) for real-world enties, and 
- Relationships (edges) connecting the nodes
- Both can have additional associated properties

**Non-transactional** = small number of very large graphs
**Transactional** = large number of small graphs

## RDF Stores (Resource Description Framework)

RDF is a mark-up language.
- Used for describing ontologies and resources on the Web 
- Written in XML.

RDFtriples
- Components: `<subject>, <predicate>, <object>.`
	- Each usually stored as globally unique URIs

- Each triple represents a statement about a real-world entity â€¢
- Triples can be viewed as graphs
	- Vertices for subjects and objects
	- Edges directly correspond to individual statements

Query language
- SPARQL: SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language 

# BASE Properties and Horizontal Scaling

- **ACID Properties** (Relational DBMS):
    - **A**tomicity, **C**onsistency, **I**solation, **D**urability.

- **BASE Properties** (NoSQL databases):
    
    - **B**asically **A**available,
    - **S**oft state,
    - **E**ventually consistent.

### BASE Principles

- By relaxing ACID constraints, NoSQL databases achieve better performance and scalability.

- NoSQL databases vary in their level of consistency:
    - Most are "eventually consistent" (updates reach all nodes over time).
    - Some offer mechanisms like multi-version concurrency control (MVCC) for limited consistency.
### Cap Theorem

- A system can have only two of the following:
    - **C**onsistency,
    - **A**vailability,
    - **P**artition tolerance.

- CAP theorem is central to choosing NoSQL databases.
    
    - They often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency.
    - Trade-offs depend on specific use cases.

### Horizontal Scalability

- **Horizontal scaling**:
    - Distributes data and workloads across many servers (shared-nothing architecture).
    - More cost-effective using commodity hardware.
    
- **Vertical scaling**:
    - Adds resources like cores/CPUs to a single machine (shared RAM and disks).
    - Limited by hardware constraints but enhances single-system performance.

### Horizontal vs. Vertical Scaling

- Vertical scaling effectively uses multiple cores but is limited by memory-sharing capacity.

- Horizontal scaling handles larger workloads:
    - Breaks sequential processes into parallel tasks across servers.
    - Requires data replication, increasing processing overhead.

# Example Scenarios
[[DSR-10b-examples.pdf]]

**Example 1**
- Key-Value Stores
	- Very lightweight and efficient

**Example 2**
- Document Stores
	- Since structure doesn't change frequently

**Example 3**
- RDF Stores
	- Reminds me of the wikipedia example.
