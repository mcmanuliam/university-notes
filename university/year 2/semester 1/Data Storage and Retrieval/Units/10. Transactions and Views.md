**For transactions it's already used heavily on the platform and the app, think about sign-up tokens or stripe handling. Views are most likely similar to how we handle policies in the middleware**

- Database Systems are normally being accessed by many users or processes at the same time.
	- Both queries and modifications

- Unlike operating systems, which support interaction of processes, a DBMS needs to safeguard processes from troublesome interactions.

#### Controlled Concurrent Access

- Two people try to access bank account and withdraw money at the same time, leads to Race condition.

- We can get around this by using Transactions -

### Transactions

```javascript
// Mongo Code to create a transaction, not 100% transferable but it gives a good idea of how this will work.
const session = client.startSession();  
  
try {  
  session.startTransaction();  
  
  // Decrease Alice's balance  
  const alice = db.users.findOne({ name: "Alice" }, { session });  
  db.users.updateOne(  
    { name: "Alice" },  
    { $inc: { balance: -30 } },  
    { session }  
  );  
  
  // Increase Bob's balance  
  const bob = db.users.findOne({ name: "Bob" }, { session });  
  db.users.updateOne(  
    { name: "Bob" },  
    { $inc: { balance: 30 } },  
    { session }  
  );  
  
  // Commit the transaction  
  session.commitTransaction();  
  console.log("Transaction committed successfully.");  
} catch (error) {  
  console.log("Transaction failed. Rolling back.");  
  session.abortTransaction();  
} finally {  
  session.endSession();  
}
```

- Transaction = Process involving database queries and/or modification.
- Normally with some strong properties regarding concurrency.
- Formed in SQL from single statements.

- **ACID transactions are:**
	- ***Atomic***: Whole transaction or none is done
	- ***Consistent***: Database constraints preserved.
	- ***Isolated***: It appears to the user as if only one process executes at a time
	- ***Durable***: Effects of a process survive a crash.


## Transaction Operations
An DBMS keeps track of when a transaction **starts**, **terminates**, and **commits** or **aborts**.

To do this, a recovery manager process tracks the following operations: 

- BEGIN_TRANSACTION
- READ or WRITE
- END_TRANSACTION
- COMMIT_TRANSACTION
- ROLLBACK

##### COMMIT
The SQL statement COMMIT causes a transaction to complete. 

- It's database modifications are now permanent in the database.

```javascript
session.commitTransaction();
```

##### ROLLBACK
 The SQL statement ROLLBACK also causes the transaction to end, but by aborting. 

 - No effects on the database. 
 - Failures like division by 0 or a constraint violation can also cause rollback, even if the programmer does not request it.

```javascript
session.abortTransaction();
```

### Isolation Levels
SQL defines four *isolation levels*
###### 1. READ UNCOMMITTED
- Transactions can see uncommitted changes from others, allows **Dirty Reads** - Reading data that may later be rolled back.
###### 2. READ COMMITTED
- Transactions can only see committed changes. **Non-Repeatable Reads** - The same data might change if read again.
###### 3. REPEATABLE READ
- Transactions see the same data on repeated reads.**Phantom Reads** - New rows may appear if data is queried again. Ensures consistent data for repeated reads.
###### 4. SERIALIZABLE
- Transactions act like they run one at a time (fully isolated). Can cause for performance issues. For maximum accuracy, e.g., banking.

###### IN USE
Your choice, e.g., run serializable, affects only how you see the database, not how others see it.

```sql
SET TRANSACTION ISOLATION LEVEL READ COMMITTED;
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
-- Perform operations
COMMIT;
```

## Views
Essentially just policies, a query to determine what certain people can see.

```sql
CREATE VIEW CanDrink AS
	SELECT drinker, beer 
	FROM Frequents, Sells 
	WHERE Frequents.bar = Sells.bar;
```

- [x] ðŸ”¼  Scheduling Transactions: Practice Questions âœ… 2024-11-26

Scheduling of transactions is under the control of a transaction manager and may involve different users submitting transactions that execute concurrently, for example accessing and updating same database records. The transaction manager is responsible for interleaving the different transactions safely.

In the following examples, the transaction operations that denote the beginning and end of transactions have not been applied. Can you identify the problems that occur when the transaction operations are omitted and identify which transaction operations should be applied to protect against or solve the issues?

**Problem 1**: Starting value x = 100 

| Time | S1            | S2            |
| ---- | ------------- | ------------- |
| t1   | read_item(x)  |               |
| t2   | x := x - 40   | read_item(x)  |
| t3   | write_item(x) | x := x + 20   |
| t4   |               | write_item(x) |

**Question 1**: Will the view of the data be correct at the end of this sequence? If not, describe the sequence of events that results in an incorrect view of the data and where the error occurs. What is the final value of x?

120

**Problem 2**: 

| Time | S1           | S2            |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- |
| t1   |              | read_item(x)  |
| t2   |              | x := x-20     |
| t3   |              | write_item(x) |
| t4   | read_item(x) |               |
| t5   |              | ?             |

**Question 2**: (a) Remembering that the transaction operations have not been applied, what could transaction operation would result in an inconsistent view of the data if applied at t5?

write_item(x)

(b) what transaction operation could be applied to fix the problem and when should it be applied?

commit_data(x)
