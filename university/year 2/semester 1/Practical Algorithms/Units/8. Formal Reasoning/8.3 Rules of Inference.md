# Rules of Inference for Propositional Logic

## *Modus Ponens*

![[Pasted image 20241217102158.png]]

**Example**: 
- Let p be "It is snowing." 
- Let q be "I will study discrete math." 

- "If it is snowing, then I will study discrete math." 
- "It is snowing." 
- "Therefore , I will study discrete math."

**Corresponding Tautology:** $(p \wedge (p → q)) → q$

## *Modus Tollens*

![[Pasted image 20241217102253.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology**: $(¬ q∧( p → q))→¬ p$

**Example**: 
- Let p be "it is snowing."
- Let q be "I will study discrete math." 

- "If it is snowing, then I will study discrete math."
- "I will not study discrete math." 
- "Therefore , it is not snowing."

## *Hypothetical Syllogism*

![[Pasted image 20241217102437.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology**: $((p → q) ∧ (q→ r))→(p→ r)$

**Example**: 
- Let p be "it snows." 
- Let q be "I will study discrete math."
- Let r be "I will get an A."

- "If it snows, then I will study discrete math."
- "If I study discrete math, I will get an A."
- "Therefore , If it snows, I will get an A."

## *Disjunctive Syllogism*

![[Pasted image 20241217102722.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology:** $(¬ p∧( p ∨ q))→ q$

**Example**: 
- Let p be "I will study discrete math."
- Let q be "I will study English literature." 

- "I will study discrete math or I will study English literature." 
- "I will not study discrete math."
- "Therefore , I will study English literature."

## *Addition*

![[Pasted image 20241217102828.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology**: $p →( p ∨ q)$

**Example**:
- Let p be "I will study discrete math."
- Let q be "I will visit Paris." 

- "I will study discrete math."
- (p is TRUE) 

- "Therefore, I will study discrete math or I will visit Paris."
- (p V q) is TRUE

## *Simplification*

![[Pasted image 20241217102931.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology:** $( p∧q) → p$

**Example**:
- Let p be "I will study discrete math."
- Let q be "I will study English literature."

- "I will study discrete math and English literature"
- (p and q is TRUE)

- "Therefore, I will study discrete math."
- (p is TRUE)

## *Conjunction*

![[Pasted image 20241217103035.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology:** (( p) ∧ (q)) →(p ∧ q)

**Example**:
- Let p be "I will study discrete math." 
- Let q be "I will study English literature."

- "I will study discrete math."
- "I will study English literature." 

- "Therefore, I will study discrete math and I will study English literature."

## *Resolution*

![[Pasted image 20241217103126.png]]

**Corresponding Tautology:** ((¬ p ∨ r ) ∧ ( p ∨ q)) →( q ∨ r)

**Example**:
- Let p be "I will study discrete math."
- Let r be "I will study English literature." 
- Let q be "I will study databases." 

- "I will not study discrete math or I will study English literature."
- "I will study discrete math or I will study databases."

- "Therefore, I will study databases or I will study English literature."

# Methods of Proof
A proof is a valid argument that establishes the truth of a statement.

- Theorem: A statement (proposition) that has been proven to be true, using 
	- other theorems 
	- axioms (propositions which are given as true)* 
	- rules of inference 

- A conjecture is a statement that is being proposed to be true. 
	- Once a proof of a conjecture is found, it beco

## Direct and Indirect Proofs

Direct proof: based on the implication P➝Q
1. assume P is true
2. show Q is true using 
	- rules of inference 
	- theorems already proved

Indirect proof: based on contrapositive P➝Q ≡ ¬Q➝¬P
1. assume that Q is false (¬Q is true)
2. show P is false (¬P is true) using 
	- rules of inference
	- theorems already proved
