## Hashing: Overview

![[Pasted image 20241115103529.png]]

### Key Concepts:

- **Generalization of Direct-Address Tables**:
    - Hashing generalizes direct-address tables by introducing a **hash function**.
    - Key components:
        1. **Hash table (bucket array)**: An array T[0,…,m−1] with a fixed size mm.
        2. **Hash function h:U→{0,1,…,m−1} Maps keys from a universe U to slots in T.
        
- **Hash Collisions**:
    - Occurs when two keys map to the same slot $h(k1)=h(k2)$, where $k_1≠k_2$.
    - Collisions are inevitable if $∣U∣>m$ (more keys than slots).
    - A "good" hash function should spread keys as evenly as possible across the table to minimize collisions.
    
- **Desirable Properties of Hash Functions**:
    - Simplicity and speed in computation.
    - Keys should be distributed uniformly across the hash table, ensuring fair utilization of slots.
    
- **Performance**:
    - Hash tables support **INSERT**, **DELETE**, and **SEARCH** operations in $O(1)$ time **on average**, given a good hash function.

### Encoding General Keys as Natural Numbers

- Many hash functions work with natural numbers ($U = \mathbb{N}$).
- Conversion methods (hash codes) for other data types:
	
    - **Integer casting**: Directly uses numeric keys.
    - **Component sum**: Sums numeric components of a key (e.g., digits or ASCII values).
    - **Memory address**: Uses memory location as the key.
    - **Polynomial hashing**
    
- Here we will only describe integer casting and component sum here, very briefly

### Common Hashing Methods

#### Truncation:
- Use the first/last few digits of the key.
    - **Problem**: Regular patterns in input keys may lead to clustering and increased collisions.
    - **Example**:
        - Student IDs like `20231734` are sequential.
        - Using the first digits (e.g., `2023`) causes clustering.
        - Using the **last three digits** (e.g., `734`) distributes keys better.

#### Division:
- Computes $mh(k) = k \mod m$: The remainder of kk divided by mm.
    - **Python implementation**: `km(k) = k \% m`.
    - **Best practices**:
        - Choose m to be **prime** and not close to a power of 2.
        - Example:
            - Binary: $$ 101011_{2} \% 102 = 12, 101011_{2} \% 100_{2} = 11_{2} $$
            - Decimal: $$234_{10} \% 10_{10} = 4_{10}, 234_{10} \% 100_{10} = 34_{10}$$
#### Choosing Mm (Hash Table Size):
- Suppose we need to store ~5000 keys.
- Select mm as a **prime number** near 5000 but not near powers of 2:
    - Examples: 4987, 4993, 4999, 5003, 5009, 5011.
    - A possible hash function: $h(k) = k \mod 4993$

## How Python Uses Hashing
- **Python's `dict` and `set` Built-ins**:
    - Both `dict` and `set` in Python rely on hash tables for efficient storage and retrieval.
    - Operations like **lookup**, **insertion**, and **deletion** are optimized to $O(1)$ average time.
    
- **Hash Functions in Python**:
    - Python uses the built-in `hash()` function to compute hash values for objects.
        - Example:
            
            ```python
            print(hash(42))  # Output: 42
            print(hash("hello"))  # Output: A hash integer for the string "hello"
            ```
            
    - Custom objects can define their own hash behavior using the `__hash__` method.
    
- **Key Features**:
    - The size of the hash table grows dynamically to maintain performance.
    - The hash function in Python ensures a uniform distribution, even for non-numeric data types.
    - This means pythons inbuilt: `in`, `.get`, `.update` all runs at best $o(1)$ and at worst $o(n)$

## Linear Probing and Inserting

When a collision occurs (i.e., the target bucket is already occupied), **linear probing** sequentially checks the next bucket (moving one step at a time) until an empty slot is found.

### Steps of Linear Probing

1. **Calculate the hash index**: Compute the equation with length given, so for this it would be 8:

```python
print(128 % 8)
```

    
1. **Check the target bucket**:
    - If the bucket is empty, place the key there.
    - If the bucket is occupied, move to the next bucket.
    
2. **Repeat the process**:
    - Keep probing the next buckets in a circular manner (wrapping around using modulus) until an empty slot is found.
    
3. **Insert the key**:
	- Once an empty slot is found, store the key there.
