## What?
- "Abstract away" the details of how a particular data structure is implemented, and focus only on what it does.
- In other words, we focus on the interface

- E.g., in a recent lecture we saw that we can use a linked-list ("how") in order to implement the FIFO behaviour of a queue ("what").

## Stacks: Array Implementation
***When we say Arrays, we don't mean Arrays in python, it's more lists with a fixed length.

- The Stack ADT stores arbitrary elements
- Insertions and deletions follow the LIFO (last-in-first-out) policy

- **Main stack operations**
	- PUSH(S,x): insert element x in stack S
	 - POP(S): remove and return the most recently inserted element from stack S
	
- **Auxiliary stack operations**
	- PEEK(S): return (but don't remove) the most recently inserted element from stack S (sometimes called TOP(S))
	- SIZE(S): return the number of elements stored in stack S
	- EMPTY(S): test if stack S is empty

- A simple way of implementing a bounded stack is to use a (static) arrays
	- Add/remove elements from the right end of the arrays
	- An attribute `S.stop`keeps track of the top element

- Array S[0..n-1] implements a stack of at most n elements
- The stack consists of subarray S[0..S.top] where S.top < n
	- S[0] is the element at the bottom of the stack
	- S[S.top] is the element at the top
	- When S.top = -1 the stack is empty

### Stack Overflow
 - The maximum size of the stack must be defined a priori and cannot be changed in run-time.
- The array storing the stack elements may become full/empty
	- If we push into a full stack, the stack overflows
	- If we try to pop an empty stack, the stack underflows
- Overflows are a limitation of the static array implementation, not of the Stack ADT in general

***In our pseudocode we will ignore stack overflows***

### Implementation

```python
# Array Implementation of Stacks: Operations

def push(S, x):
	S.top += 1
	S[S.top] = x

def pop(S):
	 if EMPTY(S):
		 throw error(“underflow”)
		 return
	
	 S.top := S.top - 1 
	 return S[S.top + 1]

def empty(S) 
	return S.top == -1
```


- What is the stack formed by carrying out the following sequence of instructions?

- PUSH(S,2) [2^]
- PUSH(S,3) [2, 3^]
- PUSH(S,5) [2, 3, 5^]
- POP(S) [2, 3^, 5] - Something interesting is we don't drop the 5 here we just move the index to the right and override when we push.
- PEEK(S) 3
- POP(S) [2^, 3, 5]
- PUSH(S,7) [2, 7^, 5]

## Queues
 - The Queue ADT stores arbitrary elements 
 - Insertions and deletions follow the FIFO (first-in-first-out) policy
 
 - Main queue operations
	 - ENQUEUE(Q,x): insert element x at the end (rear, tail) of queue Q
	 - DEQUEUE(Q): remove and return the element from the front (head) of queue Q
	
- Auxiliary queue operations
	- FRONT(Q): return the element at the front of queue Q, without removing it 
	- SIZE(Q): return the number of elements stored in queue Q
	- EMPTY(S): test if queue Q is empty

### Array Implementation: The Problem

- The Problem:
	- A Queue grows at one end (ENQUEUE operations are at the tail)
	- A Queue shrinks at the other end (DEQUEUE operations are at the head)
	
	- How do we use a fixed-size array to represent a Queue?

### Circular Arrays
***What we need is a logically "circular" array.***

- A bounded queue can be implemented using an array in a circular way
	- Wrapped-around array: location 0 immediately follows location n - 1 in a circular order
	
- We need two attributes of queues:
	- Q.head indexes the element at its head 
	- Q.tail indexes the next location at which a new element will be inserted into the queue
	
- Array Q[0..n-1] implements a queue of at most n - 1 elements 
	- Q[Q.tail] is a dummy/"empty" element − When Q.head = Q.tail the queue is empty
	- When Q.head is one place ahead of Q.tail, queue is ful

## OTHER ABSTRACT DATA TYPES

### The List ADT
- We have been using "lists" extensively in Python already.
	- However, it can also be viewed more abstractly as an ADT

- The List ADT stores a sequence of arbitrary elements
	- Can insert elements at any location (compare with Stack, Queue)

- Fundamental data type in most functional programming languages 

- Main list operations 
	- GET(L,i): return the element of list L at index i, without removing it
	- SET(L,i,x): replace the element of list L at index i, with x 
	- ADD(L,x): insert element x to the end of list L 
	- ADD-AT(L,i,x): insert element x at index i in list L, shifting all elements after this
	- REMOVE(L,i): remove and return the element of list L at index i, shifting all elements after this

### The Set ADT

- We have come across SET as a mathematical concept
	- An unordered collection of elements without repetition 
	- In the computing world, they can also be viewed as an abstract data type 
	
	- A Set ADT will define the following methods: 
		- ADD (S,x): add the element x to the set, if not already there
		- REMOVE (S,x): remove the element x from the set, if present
		- CONTAINS (S,x): checks if the set S contains the element x
		- SIZE (S): returns the cardinality of the set 
		- ISEMPTY(S): checks if the set is empty
	
	- Python has a built-in set data structure that implements this Set ADT

### The Map ADT
- Lists are useful for (linearly) ordered data that can be accessed by position
- In many applications, ordering our data in such a way is irrelevant: what about allowing for more general indexing by "keys" 
- Eg: storing a number against each month of the year (number of customers, items sold, etc)

- Python readily provides the dictionary data type to achieve this 

| Key     | Value |
| ------- | ----- |
| January | 123   |
| Febuary | 112   |
| March   | 99    |

- A map models a searchable collection of (key,value) pairs
	- Other names: associative array, symbol table, dictionary 
	- Multiple entries with the same key are not allowed 
		- keys must form a set 

- Main map operations
	- INSERT(M,x): add a pair x = (k,v) to map M
	- DELETE(M,x): remove a pair x = (k,v) from map M 
	- LOOKUP(M,k): if a pair with key k exists in M, return its value v 

- Auxiliary map operations 
	- EMPTY(M): test if map M is empty
