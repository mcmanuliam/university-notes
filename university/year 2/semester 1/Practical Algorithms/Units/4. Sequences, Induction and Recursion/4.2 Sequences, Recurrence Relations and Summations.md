##### Summary
- **Sequences Basics**:
    - A sequence is an **ordered list** of elements, which can be finite or infinite.
    - Commonly used in **discrete math**, **computer science**, and other disciplines.
    - Elements are often summed or manipulated in some pattern.
	
- **Examples of Sequences**:
    - Arithmetic Progression: A sequence with a **fixed difference** between terms (e.g., 1000, 1004, 1008).
    - Geometric Progression: A sequence with a **fixed ratio** between terms (e.g., 100,000, 100,000 × 2, 100,000 × $2^2$).

- **Defining Sequences**:
    - A sequence can be defined by:
        - **Formula**: Direct computation of any term e.g.$$a_n​=2n $$
        - **Recurrence Relation**: Define terms based on previous terms e.g.$$a_n=a_{n-1}+3$$
- **Challenges with Recurrence Relations**:
    - To find a term far in the sequence (e.g., 1 billionth), you would compute all prior terms.
    - This is computationally expensive (O(n)).
    
- **Solution: Closed Formula**:
    - A **closed formula** computes any term directly without recursion (e.g. $a_n=2_n$ for even numbers).
    
- **Iterative Solution Method**:
    - **Forward Substitution**: Start with the initial condition, derive terms step-by-step, and identify a pattern for a general formula.

- **Example**:
    - For $a_n = a_{n-1} + 3 \ with \ a_0 = 2$:
        - $a_1 = 5, a_2=8, a_3=11$.
        - General formula: $a_n=2+3n$.

## Sequences and Summations: Motivation

- Sequences are an ORDERED LIST of elements
	- Can be finite, or infinite
	
- Used in Discrete Math's and Computer Science in many ways, and in many other disciplines, ranging from botany to music.

- Provide solutions to certain "counting problems"

- They are an important DATA STRUCTURE
	- In this context sequences are generally referred to as "lists". e.g. lists in python.

- We often need to work with SUMS OF Elements IN AN ORDERED LIST


## Sequences: Definition

Sequences are ordered lists of elements. 
- 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 − 1, 3, 9, 27, 81, … 
- order matters (1,2,3 is not the same as 1,3,2)
- repetitions are allowed (and are "meaningful", so 1,2,2,3 is not the same sequence as 1,2,3)
- sometimes simply called "lists"

***You can refer to the concept of "Lists" and "Array" data structures, which are very similar to the concept of "Sequences" we are discussing here***

### Sequences: Definition; More Formal

Formally, a sequence (𝑎𝑛)𝑛=0 ∞ is afunction over the natural numbers: $$𝑎: ℕ ⟶ ℝ$$ 
- Examples: 
	- If 𝑎𝑛 is the sequence of all odd natural numbers, then (𝑎𝑛) = (1, 3, 5, … ). 
	- That is, 𝑎𝑛 = 2𝑛 + 1 
	- The powers of 2: (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, … ). That is, 𝑎𝑛 = 2𝑛.

## Arithmetic Progression: Motivating Example

Arrays in memory start at a particular address 
- E.g. let's say an Array A starts at address (in decimal): 1000 

Each element in the array is of a particular size 
- Say A is an array of integers, so each element's size is 4 bytes (occupies 4 addresses)

In this scenario, the starting addresses of the elements in the array will form an arithmetic progression

- Starting addresses of arrays
	- 1000
	- 1004
	- 1008
	- 1012
- Or equivalently:
	- 1000 + 0 x 4
	- 1000 + 1 x 4
	- 1000 + 2 x 4
	- 1000 + 3 x 4…

- Direct formula for address of $n^{th}$ element (where n= 0,1,2…): 1000 + n x 4

An arithmetic progression is a sequence with a common, fixed difference between any two consecutive terms.

## Geometric Progression: Motivating Example

Any quantity going by a particular percentage at regular intervals
- E.g., say population of a place is initially 100,000, and grows by 2% every year 
- So year-wise population
	- 100,000 
	- 100,000 × 1.02 
	- 100,000 × 1.02 × 1.02 = 100,000 × 1.022 
	- 100,000 × 1.02 × 1.02 × 1.02 = 100,000 × 1.023 

- Population at year = n (where for first year, n = 0) 
	- 100,000 × 1.02

An geometric progression is a sequence with a common, fixed ratio between any two consecutive terms.

## Representing Sequences

Sequences can sometimes be arbitrary with no "pattern": 

$$A = \{4, 7, 56, 12312, 3, 1, 0, 1, 2, 2\} $$
We are more interested in Sequences that follow a certain PATTERN, where we can specify the terms by:

- a) defining terms in terms of previous terms(s) (recurrence relation) e.g. Arithmetic and Geometric Progressions, and/or 

- b) giving a certain FORMULA for a term at any position we wish (i.e the nth term) – next subsection 

We can define a Sequences by specifying a RULE to find successive elements.

That is, we specify the first (or first few elements), and then define a recurrence relation on how to calculate subsequent terms. 

E.g. for the specifying the sequence of even numbers:

$$a_n = a_{n-1} + 2 \ (Recurrence\ Relation)$$
$$a_0=0  \ (Initial\ Condition)$$
$$\{a_n\} = 0, 2, 4, 6…   \ (Resulting\ Sequence\ i.e\ solution)$$

#### Recurrence Relations: Example 1
Let ($𝒂_𝒏$) be a sequence defined by the recurrence relation

$$a_0=2$$
$$a_n=a_{n-1}+3$$

What are the values of the terms 𝒂𝟏, 𝒂𝟐 and 𝒂𝟑 ?

$$a_1=3$$
$$a_2=4$$
$$a_3=5$$

#### Recurrence Relations: Example 2
Let ($𝒂_𝒏$) be a sequence defined by the recurrence relation:

$$a_0=3$$
$$a_1=1$$
$$a_n=a_{n-1}-{a_{n-2}}$$
What are the values of 𝒂𝟐 and 𝒂𝟑 ?

$$a_2=1$$
$$a_3=1$$

### Problem?

- Say that, given a recurrence relation we want to find the nth element of a sequence (e.g. n = 1 billion) − You can consider the sequence of even numbers for illustration 

- We can find it through the use of recurrence relations, but we will have to compute the previous 999,999,999 elements first before we can compute the 1 billionth element

- In other words, this is an O(n) computation

- Can you tell me, directly, what the 1 billionth even number is?

### Cunning Plan?

#### Representing Sequences: FORMULAS

We can specify the terms by giving a certain **FORMULA** for a **DIRECTLY COMPUTING** term at any position we wish (i.e the nth term)

Example: Consider the sequence ${a_n}=0,2,4,6…$
- the nth term in this sequence can be given directly by this ***formula***
$$a_n = 2n$$
- Now compute the 1 billionth term of this sequence: how many steps did you take?


#### Solving Recurrence Relations

 - Finding a formula for the nth term of the sequence generated by a recurrence relation is called solving the recurrence relation.
 
 - Such a formula is called a closed formula.
 
 - Various methods for solving recurrence relations. 
 
 - Here we illustrate by example the method of iteration.


#### Iterative Solution Method

- "Brute force" method of solving a recurrence relation
- Also known as forward substitution: 

	1. Start with initial condition 
	2. Work upwards/forward until you reach 𝑎𝑛 in terms of 𝑎0 (initial condition) and constants only 
	3. Try to identify the pattern and derive the formula

##### Example

Working upward, forward substitution 
1. Start with initial condition, 
2. Work upward until you reach an in terms of a0 (initial condition) and constants only 
3. "Deduce" formula 

Let {an} be a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation an = an-1 + 3 for n = 1,2,3,4,…. and suppose that a0 = 2


### Summations

Summation is a process of adding a sequence of numbers. It is denoted by the Greek letter **Σ** (sigma) and often involves indices to indicate the range of terms being summed.
$$
\sum_{i=m}^n a_i = a_m + a_{m+1} + \dots + a_n
$$
- **\(i\):** Index of summation (iterates through the range of summation).
- **\(m\):** Lower limit of summation (starting index).
- **\(n\):** Upper limit of summation (ending index).
- **\(a_i\):** The terms of the sequence.

**Examples**
1. **Finite Summation:**
   Compute  \sum_{i=1}^4 i
   $$= 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 $$

2. **Using a Formula for Terms:**
   For a_i = 2i , calculate: $$\sum_{i=1}^3 a_i $$$$
   \sum_{i=1}^3 2i = 2(1) + 2(2) + 2(3) = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12
   $$

1. **Computing Totals:**
   - Used to find the sum of elements in arrays or data structures.
   - Useful in algorithmic complexity and computational problems.

3. **Analyzing Patterns:**
   - Arithmetic and geometric progressions.
   - Recursive formula-based calculations.

4. **Problem Solving:**
   - Calculating aggregate values in probability, statistics, and finance.

5. **Mathematical Constants and Functions:**
   - Many transcendental functions and constants (e.g., \(e\), \(\pi\)) involve summations over infinite sequences.

6. **Product Notation:**
   Represented by \(\prod\), denoting the product of a sequence:$$
   \prod_{i=m}^n a_i = a_m \cdot a_{m+1} \cdot \dots \cdot a_n
   $$

2. **Summation Over a Set:**
   - Specify indices using a set \(S\) rather than sequential indices:$$
     \sum_{i \in S} a_i
     $$
