# Counting Possibilities
You will be given a problem along the lines of "how many **combinations** are there of **string** where **conditions**."

For this you can break it down into sections, here's this example:

How many houses can I address with this postcode format: Z-XXX-NNN.

- Z represents the capital English alphabet 'Z' itself.
- X represents any capital letter of the English alphabet, except these three: 'Z', 'O' and 'I' 
- N represent a digit from 0 to 9

**Solution:**

$Z = 1$
$N = 10^3$
$X = (26-3)^3$

$Total = 2,167,000$

# Closed Formula
You'll be given a problem along the lines of "let **Sequence** be a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation **Relation**. Suppose **First Instance**. Find its closed formula using the iterative method

For this you figure out the first few items in the sequence then find the pattern, here's this example:

Let $\{b_n\}$ be a sequence that satisfies the recurrence relation $b_n = 2b_{n-1}$. Suppose $b_0 = 1$. Find its closed formula using the iterative method

**Solution:

$b_0=1$
$b_1=2$
$b_2=4$
$b_3=8$
$b_4=16$

$\text{Closed Formula}: b_n=2^n$

# Combinations
The number of ways to choose r objects from n distinct objects (order does not matter) is given by the **combination formula**:

$(\frac{r}n​)=\frac{n!}{r!(n−r)!}​$

Here's an example:

You have 5 CPU-only computers (Type A) and 9 CPU+GPU computers (Type B). You need to create a cluster of 10 computers with an equal number of each type. How many ways can you do this?

1. Choose 5 Type A computers from 5 available:

	 $(\frac{5}5​)=\frac{5!}{5!(5−5)!}​=1$

2. Choose 5 Type B computers from 9 available:

	 $(\frac{9}5​)=\frac{9!}{5!(9−5)!}​=126$

3. **Total ways to form the cluster:**

	$1×126=1261 \times 126 = 126$
