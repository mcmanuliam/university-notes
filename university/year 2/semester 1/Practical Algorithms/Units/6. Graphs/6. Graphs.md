# *Undirected Graphs:* Definition

- A graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of:
	- V a finite, non empty set of vertices (Imagine the nodes themselve)
	- E  ⊆ { 𝒖, 𝒗 | 𝒖, 𝒗 ∈ 𝑽 and 𝒖 ≠ 𝒗} the end set (Imagine the connections)

- Here we only study simply graphs: No "self-loops" or "parallel" / multiple edges are allowed by our definition.
- For an edge 𝒆 = 𝒖, 𝒗 ∈ 𝑬 we say that nodes 𝒖 and 𝒗 are the endpoints of 𝒆

***Note: the definition does not allow loops*** 
- i.e. edges joining vertices to themselves 
- an edge is defined as a set, so same element cannot be repeated 

**Note: the definition does not allow multiple edges**
- i.e. two edges between the same vertices
## Example

This is a graph with four vertices and five edges

![[Pasted image 20241129103145.png]]

**Definition:** Graph $G = (V, E)$ consists of 
- V, a finite, non-empty set of vertices (the vertex set)
- E, a set of edges.
	- Each edge is a subset of V of size 2.

$$V = \{a, b, c, d\}$$$$E = \{ \{a,b\}, \{a,c\}, \{b,c\}, \{b,d\}, \{c,d\} \}$$
## Example Loops

- the edge {v,v} equals the set containing only v, i.e. {v}
- that is, an edge {v,v} is meaningless

![[Pasted image 20241129103554.png]]

## Example Multiple Edges

- both e1 and e2 equal {v, w} and E is a set 
- so edge between u and v can only appear once

# Graph - Terminology

![[Pasted image 20241129103948.png]]

$$V=\{a,b,c,x,y,z\}$$$$ E=\{ \{a,x\},\{a,y\},\{a,z\}, \{b,x\},\{b,y\},\{b,z\}, \{c,x\},\{c,y\},\{c,z\} $$
**In this graph**: 
- vertices a & z are adjacent that is {a,z} is an element of the edge set E (they have a connection)
- vertices a & b are non-adjacent that is {a,b} is not an element of E (they dont have a connection)
- vertices A is incident to edge e (a part of connection e)
- the degree of a vertex is the number of edges to it is incident to (the number of connections)
- In this graph all vertices have degree 3

# *Directed Graphs*: Definition

- A directed graph (digraph) $D = (V, E)$
	- V is the finite set of vertices and E is the finite set of edges
	- here each edge is an **ordered** pair of vertices (element V x V)

- Pictorially: edge are drawn as directed lines/arrows

![[Pasted image 20241129104508.png]]

$$V=\{u,v,w,x,y,z\}$$ $$E=\{ (u,v),(u,w),(w,x), (w,y),(y,w),(z,y) \}$$
**In this graph:**
- u is the source (initial) vertex of edge e=(u,v)
- v is the target (final) vertex of edge e=(u,v)
- u is adjacent to v and v is adjacent from u
- y has in-degree 2 
	- in-degree of vertex y: the number of edges that has y as its target
- y has out-degree 1 
	- out-degree of vertex y: the number of edges that has y as its source

# Representing Graphs

## Adjacency Lists
An adjacency list can be used to represent a graph with no multiple edges by specifying the vertices that are adjacent to each vertex of the graph.

![[Pasted image 20241129104851.png]]


### Adjacency Matrix
These are essentially an explanation of the connections for a graph, this was represented as this:

![[Pasted image 20241129105211.png]]

For an undirected graph with n vertices, adjacency matrix is the n × n zero-one matrix
- with 1 as its (i, j)th entry when ith and jth vertex are adjacent,
- and 0 as its (i, j)th entry when they are not adjacent

It is possible to represent directed graphs as well

#### Example

# Graph Isomorphism & Connectivity

When are graphs two graphs "similar"? When do they have the same structure? (That is, if we were to rename the vertices of one, it becomes the other)

**Liam Note:** Could probably be tested through extracting V and E.

![[Pasted image 20241129105519.png]]

We need the concept of Isomorphism 
- e.g. there are isomorphisms between G1 and G2 and between G3 and G

Are two graphs G1 and G2 isomorphic 
- that is, could the vertices of G1 be renamed such that G1 becomes G2

**Formally**: Undirected graphs G1=(V1,E1) and G2=(V2,E2) are isomorphic if: 
- there is a bijection f from the vertex set V1 to the vertex set V2 
- and: {v,w}∈E1 if and only if {f(v),f(w)}∈E2 
	- i.e. v and w are adjacent if and only if f(v) and f(w) are adjacent 

So far, best algorithm for checking two graphs are isomorphic is exponential, i.e O(2n), in the worst case.

**Update from future Liam:** In 2015 comp scientists were able to get it down to what Yannis called $2^{log(n)^3}$

# Connectivity

- An undirected graph is called connected if there is a path between every pair of vertices

![[Pasted image 20241129110015.png]]

- A non-connected graph has two or more connected components

# Examples of Using Graphs for Modeling

## Computer Networks

- Graphs are used massively for modelling applications a wide range of domains.
- When we build a graph model, we use the appropriate type of graph to capture the important features of the application.

## Social Networks

- Graphs can be used to model social structures based on different kinds of relationships between people or groups.

- In a social network, vertices represent individuals or organizations and edges represent relationships between them. 
- Useful graph models of social networks include: 
	- friendship graphs - undirected graphs where two people are connected if they are friends (in the real world, on Facebook, or in a particular virtual world, and so on.) 
	- collaboration graphs - undirected graphs where two people are connected if they collaborate in a specific way 
	- influence graphs - directed graphs where there is an edge from one person to another if the first person can influence the second person

**The Graph ADT:**
Graphs can be thought of as an **abstract data type** (ADT) as well, though we didn't quite introduce them that way.

With the ADT glasses on, the graph ADT is defined to have the following operations:

|Graph()|creates  a new, empty graph|
|---|---|
|add_vertex(key)|add a vertex to the graph with name "key"|
|add_edge (key1, key2)|add an edge from vertex "key1"  to vertex "key2"|
|find_vertex(key)|find the vertex named "key" in the graph|
|get_vertices()|get a list of all vertices|
|get_edges()|get a list of all edges|
|is_adjacent(key1, key2)|checks if two given vertices are adjacent|

Now, if you recall from our earlier units, an ADT needs to be implemented by an actual *data structure*. There are multiple ways to implement the graph ADT. We had a cursory look at them earlier in the lecture, where we discussed the **adjacency list** and the **adjacency matrix.**   
  
Let's work with the adjacency list representation, and use a **python dictionary** data structure to implement it. So, if we were to represent the following graph:

![[Pasted image 20241129112054.png]]
…then the following dictionary can store its *adjacency list* representation.   

```
{  
	a: {b,c},  
	b: {a,d,c},  
	c: {d,a,b},  
	d: {b,c}  
}  
```

Note that we are using the [**set** data type (built-in datatype in Python)](https://learningmonkey.in/courses/data-science/lessons/set-data-type-and-methods-in-python/) to explicitly store the names of all adjacent vertices to each vertex. You could have used a list too, but using a set is closer to the mathematical definition. Using a set also means that operations like adding edges between two nodes repeatedly is automatically taken care of (i.e., they are ignored), as multiple additions of the same element in a set results in just a single addition.   
  
So, we are now ready to start with our first problem:  
  
**1)** Create a class Graph() that implements a graph ADT. It should use a dictionary internally to store the graph, and implement all the ADT functions described above. You can use the partially completed template provided to get started.

```python
from typing import TypeAlias

weighted_edge: TypeAlias = set[tuple[str, int]]

class Graph():
	def __init__(self):
		self.graph = {};
	
	def add_vertex(self, key: str) -> None:
		if (key in self.graph):
			return
	
		self.graph[key] = set()
		
	def add_edge(self, vertex_1: weighted_edge, vertex_2: weighted_edge) -> None:
		self.graph.get(key_1, set()).add(vertex_1)
		self.graph.get(key_2, set()).add(vertex_2)
	
	def find_vertex(self, key: str) -> bool:
		return bool(self.graph.get(key, None))
		
	def is_adjacent(self, key_1: str, key_2: str) -> bool:      
	    condition_1 = key_2 in self.graph[key_1] 
	    condition_2 = key_1 in self.graph[key_2] 
		
	    return condition_1 & condition_2

graph = Graph()
graph.add_vertex("a")
graph.add_vertex("b")
graph.add_vertex("c")
graph.add_edge("a", "b")
print(graph.find_vertex("a"))
print(graph.find_vertex("t"))
print(graph.is_adjacent("a", "b"))
print(graph.is_adjacent("c", "b"))
```

**WEIGHTED GRAPHS**  
  
Until now, we have limited ourselves to *unweighted* graphs. That is, the edges did not have any *weights.* You either had an edge, or you didn't. But imagine trying to represent the rail connections between cities via a graph. Now it's not enough to represent Glasgow and Edinburgh by vertices simply being connected with an edge. The edge needs to have a *weight* that corresponds to the distance between the cities. Such graphs, where the edges have **weights** associated with them, are called *weighted graphs*.  
  
For example, the following is a weighted graph:

![[Pasted image 20241129114605.png]]
**2)** Modify the Graph() class to make a new class called  **WeightedGraph()** that can implement weighted Graphs.  The WeightedGraph() class should have the following methods:  

|WeightedGraph()|creates  a new, empty graph|
|---|---|
|add_vertex(key)|add a vertex to the graph with name "key"|
|add_edge (vertex1, vertex2, weight)|add an edge from vertex "key1"  to vertex "key2", with a certain weight|
|find_vertex(key)|find the vertex named "key" in the graph|
|get_vertices()|get a list of all vertices|
|get_edges_and_weights()|get a list of all edges and their weights|
|is_adjacent(key1, key2)|check if key1 and key2 are adjacent, returning the weight of their connection if so; return False otherwise|

  *Hint: For example, to represent the weighted graph shown above, you could use the following data structure, where the adjacency list now contains not just the adjacent vertices of each vertex, but also the weights of the edges to those adjacent vertices.*

```
{  
	a: {(b,4), (c,7)},  
	b: {(a,4), (d,10) , (c,6)},  
	c: {(d,3), (a,7), (b,6)},  
	d: {(b,10), (c,3)}  
}
```

```python
class WeightedGraph():
	def __init__(self):
		self.graph = {};
	
	def add_vertex(self, key: str) -> None:
		self.graph[key] = set()
		
	def add_edge(self, key_1: str, key_2: str, weight: int) -> None:
		self.graph.get(key_1, set()).add(key_2)
		self.graph.get(key_2, set()).add(key_1)
	
	def find_vertex(self, key: str) -> bool:
		return bool(self.graph.get(key, None))
	
	def get_edges_and_weights() -> set[]:
			
	def is_adjacent(self, key_1: str, key_2: str) -> bool:      
	    condition_1 = key_2 in self.graph[key_1] 
	    condition_2 = key_1 in self.graph[key_2] 
	    return condition_1 & condition_2

graph = Graph()
graph.add_vertex("a")
graph.add_vertex("b")
graph.add_vertex("c")
graph.add_edge("a", "b")
print(graph.find_vertex("a"))
print(graph.find_vertex("t"))
print(graph.is_adjacent("a", "b"))
print(graph.is_adjacent("c", "b"))
```
