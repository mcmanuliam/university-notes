1. **Rule 1 - Loops** 
	- The running time of a loop is at most the running time of the statements inside the loop (including loop bound tests) multiplied by the number of iterations

2. **Rule 2 – Nested loops**
	- Total running time of a statement inside a group of nested loops is running time of statement multiplied by the product of the sizes of all the loops − This way we focus on the fastest changing (inner-most) loop, as that will determine the dominant term
	
```python
ALG1(n)
	for i = 0 to n-1 # o(n)
		for j = 0 to n-1 # o(n)^2
			for k = 0 to n-1 # o(n)^3
				increment x # o(n)^3
```

1. **Rule 3 – Consecutive statements** 
	- Just add

```python
ALG1(n)
	for i = 0 to n-1 # o(n)
		read x from array # 2o(n)
		increment x # o(n)
		store x back in array # 2o(n)
```

1. **Rule 4 - if-then-else**
	- Running time is never more than the time of the *test(condition)* plus the *worst* (ie. maximum) of the two branches
	- Similarly for multiple/nested else statements

```python
ALG1(n)
	if (condition true) # o(1) 
	else #O(n)
```

And the following is the best part… we can ignore a whole lot of "clutter" and focus solely on the dominant terms.

1. **Rule 5 - Remove constant multipliers**
	$$ o(2n) -> o(n) $$
2. **Rule 6 - Drop "non-dominants** (lower-order-terms)
	$$ o(n^2) + o(n) + o(1) = o(n^2) $$
3. **Rule 7 – Assume the WORST**
