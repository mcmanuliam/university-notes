# PAPER SUMMARIES:
On the whole this part is done really well. Your reflections are authentic and insightful, and you relate effectively to personal experiences. Your writing style is very engaging. 

In some cases personal connection was stronger than others. In paper 3, an quick summary felt missing, and in paper 4, the reflection and personal relation was weaker. 
# ESSAY:
This is a really good essay, engagingly written, connecting with the paper as well as your own experiences, and leading to a convincingly developed conclusion. 

You make an interesting point about importance of context, arguing against a blanket policy that imposes rigid processes. You go on to expand on this view with a well-argued point on the importance of size and speed of the company, supported by observations from your own workplace experiences. 

Your core point of importance of context could have been further developed by bringins on other aspects of context (in addition to size and speed) as well. Your discussion on automation is also compelling, with insightful connections to your experiences. Some reflection on your experiences of working in a team in this course would have complemented your observations from your workplace.
