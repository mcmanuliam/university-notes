***NOT ASSESSED***

Example (small) programs 

```java
public void test(int n) {
	if (n==1)
		while (true)
			null;
}
```

This never terminates.

```java
public int erratic(int n){
	while (n != 1)
		if (n % 2 == 0) n = n/2;
		else n = 3*n + 1;
	}
```

For example if 'erratic' is called with `n=7` sequence of values: 

```
22, 11, 34, 17, 52, 26, 13, 40, 20, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 
```

Nobody knows whether 'erratic' terminates for all values of `n`.

## Undecidability

A formal definition of the halting problem (HP) 

**Instance**: a legal Java program X and an input string S for X âˆ’ can substitute any language for Java 
**Question**: does X halt when run with input S?

Theorem: **HP** is undecidable
