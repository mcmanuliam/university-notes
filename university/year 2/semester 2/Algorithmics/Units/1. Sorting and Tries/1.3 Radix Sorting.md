#algo

No sorting algorithm that is based on pairwise comparisons can be better than `O(n log n)` in the worst case see [[1.2 Comparison based-sorting]] for a more detailed explanation.

- therefore, to improve on this worst case bound, we have to devise a method based on something other than comparisons

This one takes a bit of explanation, it exploits the binary structure to efficiently sort.

Assume items to sort can be treated as a binary sequence of length `m`:
- `let b` be a chosen factor of `m` (`b` divides `m`)
- `b` and `m` are constants for any particular instance
- choosing `b`:
	- `b = 1` leads to m iterations and 2 buckets 
	- `b = m` leads to 1 iteration and 2 m buckets

It's best to explain with an example:

```
15 43 5 27 60 18 26 2
```

Binary encodings are given as:

```
15 = 001111    43 = 101011 
5 = 000101     27 = 011011 
60 = 111100    18 = 010010 
26 = 011010    2 = 000010
```

- items have bit positions `0,…,5`, hence `m = 6`
- b must be a factor of m, so say we choose `b = 2`

**First iteration we grab the least significant `b` bits and sort into buckets**:

```
1st iteration:

bucket 00: 60         // 0
bucket 01: 5          // 1
bucket 10: 18 26 2    // 2
bucket 11: 15 43 27   // 3
```

We then concat and start again: 

```
New sequence: 60 5 18 26 2 15 43 27
```

**Second iteration we grab the next set of least significant `b` bits and sort into buckets**:

```
2nd iteration:

bucket 00: 18 2
bucket 01: 5
bucket 10: 26 43 27
bucket 11: 60 15
```

We then concat and start again: 

```
New sequence: 18 2 5 26 43 27 60 15
```

**Final iteration we grab the last set of `b` bits and sort into buckets**:

```
3rd iteration:

bucket 00: 2 5 15
bucket 01: 18 26 27
bucket 10: 43
bucket 11: 60
```

And finally

```
Final sequence: 2 5 15 18 26 27 43 60
```

# Pseudocode

```java
// assume we have the following method which returns the value 
// represented by the b bits of x when starting at position pos
private int bits(Item x, int b, int pos) 

// suppose that: 
// a is the sequence to be sorted 
// m is the number of bits in each item of the sequence a 
// b is the ‘block length’ of radix sort 

int numIterations = m/b; // number of iterations required for sorting 
int numBuckets = (int) Math.pow(2, b); // number of buckets 

// represent sequence a to be sorted as an ArrayList of Items 
ArrayList a = new ArrayList(); 

// represent the buckets as an array of ArrayLists 
ArrayList[] buckets = new ArrayList[numBuckets]; 
for (int i=0; i<numBuckets; i++) buckets[i] = new Arraylist<Item>();

for (int i=1; i<=numIterations; i++){
	// clear the buckets 
	for (int j=0; j<numBuckets; j++) buckets[j].clear();

	 // distribute the items (in order from the sequence a)
	 for (Item x : a){
		 // find the value of the b bits starting from position (i-1)*b in x
		 int k = bits(x, b, (i-1)*b); // find the correct bucket for item x
		 buckets[k].add(x); // add item to this bucket
	 }
	
	 a.clear(); // clear the sequence
	 // concatenate the buckets (in sequence) to form the new sequence
	 for (j=0; j<numBuckets; j++) a.addAll(buckets[j]);
 }
```
