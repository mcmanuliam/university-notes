NP - Non Deterministic Polynomial Time

A `polynomial-time reduction (PTR)` is a mapping `f` from a decision problem $Π_1$ to a decision problem $Π_2$ such that:

for every instance $I_1$ of $Π_1$ we have:
- the instance f($I_1$) of $Π_2$ can be constructed in polynomial time 
- f($I_1$) is a 'yes'-instance of $Π_2$ if and only if $I_1$ is a 'yes'-instance of $Π_1$

We write $Π_1 ∝ Π_2$ as an abbreviation for: 
- there is a polynomial-time reduction from $Π_1$ to $Π_2$

## Properties

Transitivity: $Π_1 ∝ Π_2$ and $Π_2 ∝ Π_3$ implies that $Π_1 ∝ Π_3$

Since $Π_1 ∝ Π_2$ and $Π_2 ∝ Π_3$ we have 
- a PTR `f` from $Π_1$ to $Π_2$ 
- a PTR `g` from $Π_2$ to $Π_3$

Now for any instance $I_1$ of $Π_1$ since f is PTR we have
- $I_2=f(I_1)$ is an instance of $Π_2$ that can be constructed in polynomial time 
- $I_2$ has the same answer as $I_1$

and since g is a PTR we have
- $I_3=g(I_2)$ is an instance of $Π_3$ that can be constructed in polynomial time
- $I_3$ has the same answer as $I_2$

Putting the results together: for any instance $I_1$ of $Π_1$ 
- $I_3=g(f(I_1))$ is an instance of $Π_3$ constructed in polynomial time 
- $I_3$ has the same answer as $I_1$
- i.e. the composition of f and g is a PTR from from Π1 to Π3

## Example

Reducing Hamiltonian cycle problem to travelling salesperson problem.
- `G = (V,E)` is an instance of `HC`
- construct TSDP instance `f(G)`

- f(G) can be constructed in polynomial time 
- f(G) has a tour of length ≤|V| if and only if G has a Hamiltonian cycle (tour includes |V| edges so cannot take any of the edges with weight 2) 
- therefore TSDP∈P implies that HC∈P 
- equivalently HC∉P implies that TSDP∉P (contrapositive)
