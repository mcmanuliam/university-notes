# Definition
- **Undecidable** - no algorithm of any sort could solve them
- **Intractable** - can be solved but not in polynomial time

No polynomial-time algorithm is known for an NP-complete problem 
- however, if one of them is solvable in polynomial time, then they all are No proof of intractability is known for an NP-complete problem 
- however, if one of them is intractable, then they all are 

There is a strong belief in the community that NP-complete problems are intractable
- we can think of all of them as being of equally difficulty

# Intractable Problems

Two different causes of intractability (no polynomial algorithm):
1. Polynomial time is not sufficient in order to discover a solution
2. Solution itself is so large that exponential time is need to output it

We will be concerned with case 1
- There are intractability proofs for case 1
- Some problems have been shown to be **undecidable** (no algorithm of any sort could solve them)
- Some decidable problems have been shown to be intractable (can be solved but not in polynomial time)

## Roadblock

A decidable problem that is intractable: **Roadblock** 
- there are two players: A and B
- there is a network of roads, comprising intersections connected by roads 
- each road is coloured either black, blue or green 
- some intersections are marked either "A wins" or "B wins" 
- a player has a fleet of cars located at intersections 
	- at most one per intersection

Player A begins, and subsequently players make moves in turn 
- by moving one of their cars on one or more roads of the same colour 
- a car may not stop at or pass over an intersection which already has a car 

The problem is to decide, for a given starting configuration, whether A can win, regardless of what moves B t

A moves first and A can win, no matter what B does. How?
- A moves (along the green road)
- B moves (along the black road) to try and stop A from winning on its next turn
- but A can still win (by moving along the black road)

if B does not do this A could move to the same place and win.
