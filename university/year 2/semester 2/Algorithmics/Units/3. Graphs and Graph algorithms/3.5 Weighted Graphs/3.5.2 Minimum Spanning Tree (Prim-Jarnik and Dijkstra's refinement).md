# Spanning Trees

- Subgraph (subset of edges) which is both a tree and `spans` every vertex
- A spanning tree is obtaintained from a connected graph by deleing edges
- The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of all it's edges.

	**Problem**: for a weighted connected undirected graph, find a min weight spanning tree.
	 - Find a tree with the lowest weight with all nodes connected:

An example of a problem in `combinational optimisation`
- find `best` way of doing something among a (large) number of candidates
- can aways be solved, in theory, by `exhausive search`
- although this isn't practical.

The **Prim-Jarnik** minimum spanning tree algorithm
- an example of a `greedy` algorithm
- it makes a sequence of decisions based on local optimality
- and ends up with the `globally optimal` solution

# The Prim-Jarnik Algorithm

Min spanning tree is  constructed by choosing a sequence of edges:

```java
// set an arbitrary vertex r to be a tree-vertex (tv);
// set all other vertices to be non-tree-vertices (ntv);

while (number of ntv > 0) {
	find edge e = {p,q} of the graph such that
		p is a tv;
		q is an ntv;
		wt(e) is minimised over such edges;

	adjoin edge e to the (spanning) tree;
	make q a tv;
}
```

Might be easier to show this with an example:

Repeat until you have a path setup:

## Analysis

```java
// set an arbitrary vertex r to be a tree-vertex (tv);
// set all other vertices to be non-tree-vertices (ntv);

while (number of ntv > 0) {
	find edge e = {p,q} of the graph such that
		p is a tv;
		q is an ntv;
		wt(e) is minimised over such edges;

	adjoin edge e to the (spanning) tree;
	make q a tv;
}
```

(n is the number of vertices)
- initialisation `O(n)` (`n` operations to set vertices to be `tv` or `ntv`) 
- the outer loop is executed n-1 times 
	- initially `n-1` `ntv` vertices and each iteration turns one `ntv` to a `tv`
- the inner loop `O(n^2)` and updating tree `O(1)` each iteration (!)
- so overall the algorithm is `O(n) + O(n^3)` = `O(n^3)`


# Dijkstra's Refinement

This is more efficient due to some preprocessing we do before hand - this part is extremely similar to what's done in standard `Dijkstra`, introduce an attribute `bestTV` for each non-tree vertex `(ntv)` `q`:
- `bestTV` is set to the tree vertex (tv) `p` for which `wt({p,q})` is minimised

```java
// set an arbitrary vertex r to be a tree-vertex (tv);
// set all other vertices to be non-tree-vertices (ntv);
for (each ntv s) set s.bestTV = r; // r is the only tv

while (number of ntv > 0) {
	find ntv q for which wt({q, q.bestTV}) is minimal;
	adjoin {q, q.bestTV} to the tree;
	make q a tv;
	
	for (each ntv s) update s.bestTV;
	// update bestTV as tree vertices have changed
}
```

Another one which is easier to explain with an example:

This will repeat until we have this minimum spanning tree:

## Analysis

```java
// set an arbitrary vertex r to be a tree-vertex (tv);
// set all other vertices to be non-tree-vertices (ntv); 
for (each ntv s) set s.bestTV = r; // r is the only tv 

while (number of ntv > 0) {
	find ntv q for which wt({q, q.bestTV}) is minimal;
	adjoin {q, q.bestTV} to the tree;
	make q a tv; 

	for (each ntv s) update s.bestTV;
	// update as tvs have changed
}
```

- initialisation is `O(n)`
-  while loop is executed `n-1` times
- first and second parts each take `O(n)` so for both parts `O(n)+O(n) = O(n)`
- overall the algorithm is `O(n) + O(n2) = O(n2)`
	- while Prim-Jarnik is `O(n3)`
