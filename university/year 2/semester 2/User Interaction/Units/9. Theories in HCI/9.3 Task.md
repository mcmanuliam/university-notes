# Design Theory Task

- In your group, pick two principles of design theory (Norman) and look at the design of the Glasgow University website. Think about:

## Affordance

- Links aren't clearly indicated with underlines. Links can easily be mistaken for regular text if they lack a visual indicator.
	- **Adding Underlines:** Underlining links reinforces the idea that these texts have the affordance of being clicked, improving both discoverability and usability.

- Search isn't clearly clickable, it may not be immediately recognised as a clickable element
	- **Hover:** A lighter shade on hover invites the user to click, showing interactivity.
	- **Clicked:** A darker shade on click shows that the element is actioning.

- Without a placeholder, users are left to guess what the search bar is for.
	- **Adding a Placeholder:** Insert a placeholder inside the search bar. This text serves as a gentle hint, indicating to users the purpose of the field.
