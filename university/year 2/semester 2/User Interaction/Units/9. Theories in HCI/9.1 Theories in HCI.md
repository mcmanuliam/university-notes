# Affordances

- An attribute of an object that allows people to know how to use it. 
	- A mouse button invites pushing/clicking by the way it is physically constrained in its plastic shell.

- To afford means to give a clue.
- When the affordances of a physical object are perceptually obvious it is easy to know how to interact with it.

## Anti-Affordance

- Anti-affordance is the **prevention** of interaction:
	- Design a door without a know to prevent 'pulling' and facilitate 'pushing'
	- To be effective affordances and anti-affordances must be discoverable.

## What is a Signifier

- A signifier communicates behaviour
- Could be an image, text or sound that makes an affordance apparent
- Can be **deliberate**
- Can be **emergent**

# Constraints

- Constraints Restricting the possible actions that can be preformed.
- Prevents error
- Guides users towards correct, desired or useful behaviour

 - Physical – rely on properties of the physical world 
	 - e.g. can only insert the correct way: USB-A , bank cards 

- Cultural – rely on socially learned behaviours 
	- e.g., Moodle relies on roles that make sense to us because we know how a course is run, student, lecturer.

- Logical – rely on trial and common-sense reasoning 
	- e.g. An online form won't submit. Even if it doesn't highlight required fields, we can scan through and see if we left one empty – that one's probably the problem

## Logical Constraints

- Exploit people's everyday common-sense reasoning about the way the world works

- Leverage natural mappings
	- Where do you plug in the mouse?
	- Where do you plug in the keyboard?

See the example below:

- A provides no mapping. 
- B provides direct adjacent mapping between the icon and connector 
- C provides colour coding to associate the connectors with the labels
- Logical constraint: use reasoning

# Forcing Functions

- Guiding Interactions with Constraints
-  Forcing Functions: Preventing action until certain requirements are met. Balance error prevention with frustration 
	- Interlocks – Requiring actions to occur in sequence 
		- Web app that doesn't offer you functionality until you're logged in
	
	- Lock-Ins – Keeps an action active, preventing action from stopping 
		- Gmail checks if an attachment is attached before sending an email
	
	- Lock Outs – Prevents an action from occurring (typically in safety context)
		- Operators of x-ray machines cannot enter a dangerous value

# Consistency

- Design consistency 
	- Lessons learned from one system transfer to others 
	- Design interfaces to have similar operations and use similar elements for similar tasks
	
	- Consistent interfaces are easier to learn and use
		- **Internal** consistency: designing operations/interfaces to be the same within an application
		- **external** consistency: designing operations/a to be the same across applications.

# Consistency Vs Progress

- People don't like change
	- New learning is required
	- Which design is better? Irrelevant!
		- Change itself is upsetting
	- Better to be consistent.

 - Standards simplify life but can hinder future development

# Mapping

- Relationship between controls
- How would you do it?

- Relationship between controls and results
- How would you do it? 
- Many users, many mappings!

# Feedback

- Sending information back to the user about what has been done
- Includes sound, highlighting, animation, haptics
- and a combination
- Apple Haptics Controller 

# Visibility

- An elevator control panel 
- How does it work? 
- Push button for the floor you want 
- You push a button, and nothing happens. 
- Push any other button? Still nothing. 
- What do you need to do? 
- It is not visible what to do!
- You need to insert your room card in the elevator to get it to work!!!

How would you make this action more clear?
- Make the card reader more obvious 
- Provide an auditory message that says what to do (in what language?) 
- Provide a big label next to the card reader that someone enters

# One Solution: Adapting Interfaces

- Adaptable interfaces consider behaviours taken by a user and change as a result.

- How to adapt is challenging: 
	- Could get trapped in a suboptimal design if learning or playing around 
	- Wrong adaptation?

# Design Heuristics

Sometimes optimising small pieces results in a very bad design in totality, we need to zoom out and look at it as a whole.
