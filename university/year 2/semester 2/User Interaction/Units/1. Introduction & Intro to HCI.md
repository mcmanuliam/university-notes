## Data Glove: A New way to Input

- Use in Medicine and Physio therapy
	- Recording the bending of fingers
	- Feeds data of specific movements

- Use in 3D modelling
	- Ability to manipulate objects on a screen
	- Only able to move through `x`,`y` axis due to the sensor

- Hand tracking is still massively used across the industry, more for personal use.
	- Kinect, Microsoft
	- Vision Pro, Apple
	- Meta Quest, Meta

- Been heavily utilised in more VR (BUT THIS TIME WITHOUT THE GLOVE!!)
