Models of interaction are looking at two parts of a loop

- **Goal**: improve this loop
- **How do we do this?** New interaction methods and models of measuring this loop.

## Fitts' Experiment

- Four distances: 2, 4, 8, 16 in 
- Four widths: 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2 in 
- 16 combinations

This results in a lot of measurements:

- Larger target width? We're faster!
- Longer distance? We're slower!

We can find the index of difficulty through Index of Difficulty through:

- $𝑀𝑇 = 𝑎 + 𝑏 ∗ 𝑙𝑜𝑔_2 (\frac{2𝐷}𝑊)$ 
- $\text{With } 𝑙𝑜𝑔_2(\frac{2𝐷} 𝑊) = 𝐼𝐷$

As you can see we have the same width and different distance in the same time.

## Design Implications

### Easiest Places to Reach

- The easiest place to reach is where we are now
	- that's why the right click menus pop up in place.

- Also screen edges are very easy to navigate to, we can't overshoot so we can just swipe aggressively.
	- Corners are especially good.
	- You can see this across the board, nav bars, footers etc.
