# Visual Usability

- Multidisciplinary Challenges
	- Graphic design alone doesn't help us to create complex interactive systems
	- A complex interface might need to convey many messages
	
- A complex interface might need to convey many messages
	- Should provide order, patterns to help people process info

- Visual Usability
	- Designs grounded in principles of aesthetics and understanding of people
	- We should be able to design and defend a design based on heuristics

# Consistency

- Establishing consistency means setting and maintaining expectations

- External Consistency
	- Consistent with other similar applications

- Internal Consistency
	- Consistent with other parts of the application

## Types of Consistency

- Layout Consistency
	- Screens showing similar information should have all elements positions the same way.
	
- Typography Consistency
	- Use fonts, weights and sizes meaningfully and consistently

- Colour Consistency
	- Use colour to establish and maintain consistency.

- Imagery Consistency
	- Charts, Logos, Videos, Photography

## Breaking Consistency

- Can break these rules to highlight something.
- Do not change more than two aspects of a single item.

# Hierarchy

- Visual hierarchy is used to communicate structure, relationships and relative importance.
- More important items need more "Visual Weight"

# Layout

- Screen Sizes
- Positions
- White Space
- Grid

## Proximity, Scale and Alignment

- Proximity 
	- Is the relative placement of items arbitrary or meaningful? 
	
- Scale 
	- Is the relative size of elements arbitrary or meaningful? 

- Alignment 
	- Is the alignment consistent and used to represent the hierarchy?

# Test and Iterate

This all links back to this agile process mentioned in the last unit, we can create an empty black and white ui and iterate over perfecting these different aspects.
