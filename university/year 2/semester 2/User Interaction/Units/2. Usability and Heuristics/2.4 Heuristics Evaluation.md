Heuristic evaluation is a usability engineering method for finding issues in a user interface. Involves having a small set of evaluators examine an interface and judge it's compliance with usability principles.

- Usability issues are judged against standard heuristics to provide consistent targets.
- Aggregated issues are plotted.

# Evaluators

- Each evaluator finds as many problems as possible alone.
- Evaluators find different problems.
	- On average, a single evaluator finds only 35% of usability issues identified by a group
- There's diminishing returns after 5 evaluators.

# Reports

- Problems are presented as a written report. (Think of a good name)
- Problems can be captured by recording a verbal exchange between evaluator and moderator.
- This is converted into a written report by the moderator.
- **In the Assessed Exercise we will need to equally contribute to the report.**

# Aggregate Reports

- A complete list of problems is aggregated from all reports. 
- Each unique problem is labelled, and these labels are applied to all reports. 
- Each problem must be associated with a usability heuristic. 
- A matrix is created with problems along the x-axis and evaluator along the y-axis.
	- This is sorted first by y -axis (successful evaluators) and second by x -axis (difficult to find problems).
