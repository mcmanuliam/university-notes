# From Jakob's Ten Usuability Heuristics

## 1. Visibility of System Status

Designs should keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate, timely feedback.

## 2. Match between System and the Real World

The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon.

## 3. User Control and Freedom

Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exist" to leave the unwanted action.

## 4. Consistency and Standards

Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same things. Follow platform conventions.

## 5. Error Prevention

Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.

## 6. Recognition Rather Than Recall

Minimise the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. Avoid making users remember information.

## 7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

Shortcuts - hidden from novice users - may speed up the interaction for the expert user.

## 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

Interfaces should not contain information which is irrelevant. Every extra unit of information is an interface completes with the relevant units of information.

## 9. Recognise, Diagnose and Recover from Errors

Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

## 10. Help and Docs

It's best if the design doesn't need any additional explanation, However it may be necessary.

# Visibility of System Status

Show the user when loading is happening, think of Alexa indicating when it's thinking:

# Matching Software to the Real World (Skeuomorphism)

- From older iOS, remember the old camera app, notes etc.
- Match between system and the real world
- Users can carry over knowledge from the real world.

# Maintain Consistency and Adhere to Standards

- Users should not have to wonder wether different words mean do the same things.

# Error Prevention

- Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place.
- Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.
- Sometimes these aren't avoidable.

# Flexibility and Efficiency

- Shortcuts – hidden from novice users – may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users.

- Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

# Help Users Recognise, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

- Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

This error message is useless:

# Heuristics Task

- Page 1
	- Bold, Bright button with Drop shadow for a stopping button.
		- Overly dominant
		- Does nothing
		- Shouldn't exist no functionality.
	
	- Continue section isn't dominant.
		- Black text on dark blue page
		- Words are oddly highlighted
			- **Click** is underlined suggesting it's a link (it's not)
			- **Here** is capitalised but isn't emphasised enough, should be different colour and underlined.
			- **Next Page** is light blue. suggesting it's a link (it's not)

- Page 2
	- Fields have the placeholder actually populated, every time you need to edit you need to delete the text.
	
	- Dropdown for email provider has a default of Other although this doesn't work, it's mandatory for  it to be another provider.

	- Man the terms and conditions were rough
		- I do not accept Terms and Conditions
		- Scroll took about 20 mins
		- No close button, close should be in the top right, that expand button threw me off.

	- Password wasn't hidden.

	- Next button isn't dominant, cancel is the dominant one, should probably be equally dominant.
	  
- Popup with Hurry up, time is ticking
	- The Lock button was a weird choice, why would we want to Lock the modal so we can't close.
	- Close link is also funky, hid it between the copyright tag.
