# What is a Scenario?

Scenarios are narratives that explore an interface from the user's point of view.

- Using personas,
	- identify users' common tasks
	- the context where interaction will occur.
	- Identify users' goals and the steps needed to achieve the goal

- Scenarios can cover both common and uncommon usages.

We use scenarios and personas generally to: 
- Identify users' goals and the steps needed to achieve the goal
- Identify steps to be completed by the user and the system

 Normally focused on actors who have one or more roles, think about the role hierarchy too, what roles can do certain things, what roles can edit other roles. 
 
 Scenarios normally built from personas.
# Scenario vs. Storyboard

- Scenario is a narrative and may have limited or no visual aids.
- A storyboard provides visual narrative that focuses on capturing context.

# Conclusion

A user personas is a representation of the goals and behaviours of a hypothesis user type (group of users/ potential users).

Often (but not always) personas are derived from data collected through some investigative means (e.g., surveys/ interviews/ etc) which we will cover later in this course.

Scenarios useful for UX design and to help understand and create empathy for users to find the best solution and also help figure out where usability testing and understand key tasks in a product.
