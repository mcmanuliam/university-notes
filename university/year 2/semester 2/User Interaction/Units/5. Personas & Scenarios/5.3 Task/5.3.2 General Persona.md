 **_Bancho_**:

- Works in Software
- GA in apprenticeship program
- Age 18 
- **Personality**
    - Often stressed
    - Driven and determined
    - Logical
- **Tech**
    - Obsidian for note taking
    - VS Code is mostly used for editing
        - This is still quite a key difference, with some using JetBrains and others despising it.
    - Google Workspace 
- **Frustrations**
    - Moodle is massively hated
    - Git is also surprisingly frustrating
- **Goals**
    - Completing the apprenticeship
    - To do more than just pass classes
    - Learning skills that apply outside of work
- **Favourites**
    - Obsidian is loved

**Main feedback from this was:**

- Obsidian is maybe not mainstream enough that everyone would know what it is.

- **Bancho** seems like a very dedicated student. If anything, we think it could have been good to involve other factors outside of uni/tech and how they may effect student experience. Overall well done and very abstracted! - team 6

- I am not sure the photo is very relatable to the average student. It is good you've added in some personality!

- Our groups specific preferences vary but good and relatable especially in the goals!
