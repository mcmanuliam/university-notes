# What is a User Persona?

**Personas** are 'fictional' characters who represent different groups of users that would interact with our system. Personas are used to guide our design. 

## Example

A page or shorter with 
- Name 
- Photo/sketch 
- Narrative, relevant features of life, goals and behaviours, for example:
	- Personality type
	- Goals
	- Frustrations
	- Motivations
	- Preferred Channels

# Why Are Personas Important

- Aid communication between designers/developments by providing a shared points of references

- Communication is important for: 
	- Helping with planning 
	- Creating a single point of reference (e.g., shared definition) 
	- Highlighting problems earlier in the development process
	- Ensure development efforts are streamlined

# Designing Personas

There's multiple ways to do this:

- **Goal Directed**: For well developed concepts, values and goals may be defined in advanced.
	- Focuses on users end goals.
	- Personas are built around what users _want to accomplish_.

- **Role Based**: Data Driven, take into account behaviour and organisational factors. Explains behaviour patterns backed by data:
	- How frequently users do a tasks.
	- What users enjoy in specific tasks.
	- How users handle a specific tasks.

- **The Engaging Perspective**: Help create empathy and involvement in social interactions cases.
	- Speak to users on how they use systems
	- Use of stories to create more realistic personas.

- **The Fiction Based Perspective**: Based on teams understanding often unrealistic used as a starting point.
	- Totally made up perspective which is often very unrealistic
	- This still goes by biases almost removing most of the benefit of actually creating a bias.
	- Only really works for customers you have no data on, imagine an alien

We should aim to make these:

- **Engaging**: A well rounded personas design to elicit empathy
- **Fictional**: Developed without any data (so can by deeply flawed)
- **Bad Actor**: Someone who intentionally will try to break or do something unintended or wrong.

## How to Start?

1. Find the Users - Study your users to get a sense of who they are.
2. Identify relevant context and list users' attributes
3. Group users with similar attributes
4. Find patterns to form groups
5. Construct personas - one representing each different group; avoid stereotypes.

**There is a need to revisit personas over time as they can change with time, imagine a gamer, this idea has massively changed over the past 10 years.**

# Downside of Using Personas

- Personas are abstract - it is hard to understand the abstraction process from user data to persona.
- Personas are impersonal - the personifying details in personas fail to provide a sense of empathy.
- **Personifying details may mislead** - It is difficult to select personal details that do not create false constraints on the design problem.
- **Personifying details distract** - Personifying details make it hard to focus on the aspects of a persona that are critical for the design problem.
