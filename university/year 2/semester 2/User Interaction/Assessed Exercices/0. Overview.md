Both [[1.0 Brief]] and [[2.0 Brief]] heavily link to each other, the order of these tasks should be:

- Determine tasks, these should be demonstrated in the presentation and look into the heuristic problems noticed.
	- This is all that's required for the group project.

- Then hand these tasks off to the other group and we will receive the tasks they give us.
- We then will both hand each others back and aggregate the results.

# 1. Presentation Assessment

- **Website**: Yale Art School
	- Both `guide.com` and `H&M.com` are lovely website but the Yale Art School is absolutely shit.

- Determine Heuristics
	
- **Liams Tasks**
	- **Task**: Find the Opening hours and days for the dark room in Green Hall.
	
	- **Issues**:
		- It's one of the key pages
		- The details for rooms isn't linked directly on the homepage, to navigate to this I need to nav to Quicklinks which has no relation to the facilities, there's no way to access this otherwise.
		- The background also has way too much contrast making it tough to discern the text.
	
	- **Heuristics**:
		- Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
		- Quick links is a good idea as long as there is a sensical way to access it otherwise.

	- **Resolution**:
		- Add a link on the main page or a section indicating University Facilities.
