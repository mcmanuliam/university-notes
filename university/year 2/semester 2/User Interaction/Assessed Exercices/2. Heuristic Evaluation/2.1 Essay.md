For this heuristic evaluation we used three key tasks to uncover usability issues across the Yale School of Art website. 

Each evaluator conducted the tasks independently, and results were categorised using Nielsen's 10 Usability Heuristics. The matrix below captures the **number of usability issues** per evaluator, each column in the graph corresponds to a unique issue evaluators found and each row is a different evaluator.

The corresponding Usability Issues are at the bottom of the report under **Usability Issues Key**.

There were **far too many** usability issues to fully cover in this report so we decided to cut down on this list by tagging each issue with a value for `Simplicity`, `Noticeability` and `Severity`.  Once we had decided on these values we sorted by a combination of these to find the most pressing issues.
# Summary

We were able to see three main heuristics that popped up throughout the tasks and ended up causing the most noticeable and severe issues, these were as follows:  
## 8. Aesthetic & Minimalist Design

The common recurring issues throughout each task were covered under `8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design`. This hindered most of the evaluators ability to:

- Identify important areas of the page, including areas like the School Facilities, Log in and Calendars.
- Read links and content due to overwhelming colour schemes and moving backgrounds/patterns.
- Smoothly navigate through the website due to lack of clarity on where to go.

These were the most severe and obvious issues we encountered, and to any user opening the site is the first thing you notice. Many of the issues with obnoxious design features and ineffective use of space could easily be fixed and would significantly improve the user experience if changed. 

Easy fixes include:

- Correctly handling contrast of background and foreground while adhering to the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/).
- Random black bar at the bottom of the home page, this can just be removed.
- An unnecessary scroll bar on the photo lab page, where no scrolling is needed, again just remove.
- The calendar being overly long and requiring too much scrolling due to it being compressed into a narrow section of the page. This could be solved by expanding the section given to the calendar, or changing it to a paged format to prevent long scrolling times.
- The same information being found on multiple sections of the page. Ensuring there is only one section providing each part of information on each page.

Reducing the number of bright colours used, sticking to the same colour scheme throughout each page and utilising text size to indicate the importance of information on the page would enable users to spend less time trying to find where to go, improving the overall user experience.

## 6. Recognition Rather than Recall

Many of the issues covered under "Aesthetic & Minimalist Design" also had an effect on users, now having to remember where to go, rather than knowing off of the design of the page.

The long lists of text, poor formatting and awkward indentation also brought up numerous issues under the "Recognition Rather than Recall" heuristic, with it being much easier to navigate the site once you know where important sections are, that aren't obvious beforehand.

Some of the main issues included:

- No indication of previously visited links
- Long, poorly organized list of links with ineffective indentation is hard to find desired information.

| 1   | 6. Recognition rather than recall      | long, poorly organized list of links with ineffective indentation is hard to find desired information.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 2   | 2. Match Between System and Real World | It's unclear what the buttons on the top of the calendar do until you  <br>click them, like for example the one that looks like the windows  <br>logo.                                                                                                                                          |
| 3   | 5. Error prevention                    | The search button only works if you get the name exactly right  <br>(excluding case) so if I tried to search printmaking, even if  <br>printmaking is in the title, the event wont show if there are any  <br>words in the title before printmaking that I haven't included.                    |
| 4   | 1. Visibility of System Status         | The site does not make the location of the user within the website visible - users have to remember how the navigated to the page.                                                                                                                                                              |
| 5   | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | In the sign in page the combination of background colour and the very  <br>small writing makes it incredibly challenging to read some of the  <br>links to other pages.                                                                                                                         |
| 6   | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | Noisy Background and lack of whitespace makes the text on the pages less readable.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| 7   | 4. Consistency and standards           | The link for accessing a lot of information is hidden behind "Quick links". This is not the most precise language used to infer this is where you would find that information.                                                                                                                  |
| 8   | 4. Consistency and standards           | The login pages are completely inconsistent to the other pages on the site.                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 9   | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | In the grid view, the dates of the events  <br>are not emphasized enough – this is the most important piece of  <br>information and it is difficult to find                                                                                                                                     |
| 10  | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | There is lots of repeated information throughout the website. (image, date, location)                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| 11  | 7. Flexibility and efficenty of use    | Unclear Scope and Effectiveness of  <br>Filters - their specific capabilities (e.g., filter by department, event  <br>type, audience, location, keyword?) are unknown. This reduces the  <br>efficiency of finding information                                                                  |
| 12  | 3. User control and freedom            | There is not a clear button to return to the home page from any sub page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 13  | 2. Match Between System and Real World | If you click on the forgot password link on the don't have NetID  <br>login, it has a some dots and a star in the email field that are never  <br>clarified to the user what they mean.                                                                                                         |
| 14  | 4. Consistency and standards           | The page has a different background colour at different times you  <br>open it, so you wonder if you are on the same page you were before.                                                                                                                                                      |
| 15  | 6. Recognition rather than recall      | No indication of previously visited links                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| 16  | 4. Consistency and standards           | Users expect when they click on an event that the event details come  <br>straight away on the screen, but you have to scroll down to get them  <br>because there is a bunch of messages at the top.                                                                                            |
| 17  | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | In the calendar, the calendar is too long  <br>and requires a lot of scrolling to navigate. This is a poor use of space  <br>due to the narrowness of the calendar.                                                                                                                             |
| 18  | 5. Error prevention                    | Unclear Guidance Between Login Options. The page presents options for Yale NetID users and nonNetID users but may lack clear instructions or context explaining who should use which method (e.g., students vs. alumni vs. guest applicants). Users might be unsure which path applies to them. |
| 19  | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | There is an unnecessary scroll bar in the Darkrooms: General  <br>information section, as everything is visible without the scrollbar                                                                                                                                                           |
| 20  | 8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design     | There is a random black bar on the homepage if you scroll down to the bottom                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 21  | 4. Consistency and standards           | on-hover underlining of each option  <br>is not consistent. Top option underlines the hovered option – the  <br>bottom one does not.                                                                                                                                                            |
| 22  | 4. Consistency and standards           | If you hover over the 'have NetID' button, it gets underlined,  <br>whereas the 'don't have NetID' button doesn't, so you don't know if  <br>it has actually detected your cursor                                                                                                               |
|     |                                        |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
