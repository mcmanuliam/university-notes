# Question 1

```python
# If we create an array with
array = np.reshape(np.arange(64), ((4, 4, 4)))

# What command is needed to get the array?
[56, 57, 58, 59]

slice = array[2, 3]
```
# Question 2

```python
# What is the shape of the array selected by `array[array>47`?


```
# Question 3

```python
# What will be the result of the following operation in Python?

a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
print(a*b)

# [4, 10, 18]
```
# Question 4

```python
# If you have two arrays created with

array1 = np.ones((2, 4))
array2 = np.array([1, 2])

# How would you add array2 to each column of array1?

(array1.T+array2).T
```

# Question 5

```python
a = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
b = np.array([10, 20, 30])

print(a*b)
# [[10, 30, 90], [40, 100, 180]]
```

This works through broadcasting, it essentially pads out the smaller array by duplicating the first element. Till it can times it.
