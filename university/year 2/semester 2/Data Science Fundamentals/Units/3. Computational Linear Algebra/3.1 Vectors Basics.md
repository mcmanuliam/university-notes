# Text and Translation

Strings as represented in memory have a weak structure, you are unable to find similar meaning in words purely from that data. There are string differences but these mean nothing.

Looking up words in the dictionary doesn't work as translation model, no matter how brilliant your text comparison algorithms are:

- Original 
	- "The craft held fast to the bank of the burn."
	- (the vessel stayed moored to the edge of the stream) 

- Dictionary lookup
	- "L'artisanat tenu rapide à la Banque de la brûlure."
	- (the artisanal skill held quickly to the financial institution of the burn wounds) 

- Correct(ish)
	- "Le bateau se tenait fermement à la rive du ruisseau."
	- (the boat was firmly attached to the riverbank)

An effective approach is to imbue text fragments with additional mathematical structure – to place them in a vector space.

# Points in Space

- $R$ means the set of real numbers.
- $R≥0$ means the set of non-negative reals. 
- $R^n$ means the set of tuples of exactly n real numbers. 
- $R^{n×m}$ means the set of 2D arrays (matrix) of real numbers with exactly n rows of m elements. 
- The notation ($R^n$ , $R^n$) → $R$ says that than operation defines a map from a pair of $n$ dimensional vectors to a real number.

## Vector Spaces

- Any vector of given dimension n lies in a vector space, called $R^n$
- We will consider vector spaces which are equipped with two additional operations:
	* a **norm** ||x|| which allows the length of vectors to be measured. * $R^n → R≥0$
	* an **inner product** $x|y$ or $x * y$ which allows the angles of two vectors to be compared. The inner product of two orthogonal vectors is 0.


### Relation to Arrays

These vectors of real numbers can be represented by the 1D floating point arrays we called "vectors" in the first lectures of this series. But be careful; the representation and the mathematical element are different things, just as floating point numbers are not real numbers.

```python
# two 3D vectors (3 element ordered tuples)
x = np.array([0,1,1])
y = np.array([4,5,6])
a = 2

print_matrix("a", a)
print_matrix("x", x)
print_matrix("y", y)

# a = 2
# x = [0 1 1]
# y = [4 5 6]
```

# Uses of Vectors

Vectors, despite their apparently simple nature, are enormously important throughout data science. They are a lingua franca for data. Because vectors can be * composed (via addition), * compared (via norms/inner products) * and weighted (by scaling).

they can represent many of the kinds of transformations we want to be able to do to data.

- Geometric operations
	- scaling 
	- rotation 
	- flipping (mirroring) 
	- translation (shifting)
- Machine learning applications
	- transforming some data onto feature vectors 
	- creating a function that transforms feature vectors to a prediction (e.g. a class label)
- Image compression

# Different Norms

The default norm is the Euclidean norm or Euclidean distance measure; this corresponds to the everyday meaning of the word "length". A vector space of real vectors with the Euclidean norm is called a Euclidean space. The distance between two vectors is just the norm of the difference of two vectors.

A vector norm is a function that assigns a non-negative real number to each vector, quantifying its size or length.

- **L1 Norm (Manhattan Distance):** The sum of the absolute values of the vector's components. 

- **L2 Norm (Euclidean Norm):** The square root of the sum of the squares of the vector's components, representing the standard Euclidean distance. 

- **Lp Norm:** A generalisation of **L1** and **L2** norms, where p is a positive real number. 

- **Infinity Norm (Max Norm):** The maximum absolute value of the vector's components. 

# Unit Vectors and Normalisation

A unit vector has norm 1 (the definition of a unit vector depends on the norm used). Normalising for the Euclidean norm can by done by scaling the vector x by $\frac{1} {||x||_2}$ . A unit vector nearly always refers to a vector with Euclidean norm 1.

# Inner Products of Vectors

An inner product $(R^N × R^N ) → R$ measures the angle between two real vectors. It is related to the cosine distance:

# Basic Vector Statistics

Given our straightforward definition of vectors, we can define some statistics that generalise the statistics of ordinary real numbers. These just use the definition of vector addition and scalar multiplication, along with the outer product.

The mean vector of a collection of N vectors is the sum of the vectors multiplied by $1/N$.

The mean vector is the **geometric centroid** of a set of vectors and can be thought of as capturing "centre of mass" of those vectors.

# Median is Harder

Note that other statistical operations like the median can be generalised to higher dimensions, but it is much more complex to do so, and there is **no simple direct algorithm for computing the geometric median**. This is because the are not just combined operations of scalar multiplication and vector addition
