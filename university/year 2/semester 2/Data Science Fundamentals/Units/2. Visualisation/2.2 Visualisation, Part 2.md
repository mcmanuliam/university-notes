## Markers

Markers are **Geoms** that represent bar points in a coordinate system, these typically as a visual record of a discrete **observation**. **Layer identification**, the geom used for marking points can be used to differentiate layers in a plot.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)

q1 = gas[::4, :]
q2 = gas[1::4, :]
q3 = gas[2::4, :]
q4 = gas[3::4, :]

ax.scatter(q1[:, 1], q1[:, 2], label="Winter", marker="o", color="k") 
ax.scatter(q2[:, 1], q2[:, 2], label="Spring", marker=".", color="k") 
ax.scatter(q3[:, 1], q3[:, 2], label="Summer", marker="+", color="k") 
ax.scatter(q4[:, 1], q4[:, 2], label="Autumn", marker="*", color="k")

ax.legend()
ax.set_title("Layers denoted by marker geometry")
```

```python
fig = plt.figure(
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

ax.scatter(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], label='Winter', marker='o', color='C0') 
ax.scatter(q2[:,1], q2[:,2], label='Spring', marker='o', color='C1') 
ax.scatter(q3[:,1], q3[:,2], label='Summer', marker='o', color='C2') 
ax.scatter(q4[:,1], q4[:,2], label='Autumn', marker='o', color='C3')

ax.legend()
ax.set_title("Layers denoted by marker colour")
```

### Colour Choices

Choosing good colour for plots is essential in comprehension. Care should be taken if plots may be viewed in black and white printouts, where colour differences will become differences in shade alone. Also, a significant portion of the population suffers from some form of colour blindness, and pure colour distinctions will not be visible to these readers.

### Scalar Attributes

Markers can also be used to display a third or event fourth scalar attribute, instead of identifying layers in a plot.

```python
# earthquake data
# columns
# lat,long,depth,mag,n_stations 
quakes = np.loadtxt("data/quakes.txt")

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
paths = ax.scatter(quakes[:, 1], quakes[:, 0], s=10)

ax.set_title("Earthquakes in Fiji")
ax.set_xlabel("Longitude")
ax.set_ylabel("Latitude")
```

We can use the size of a Geom to show the magnitude of these Earthquakes.

```python
 fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 4))
 ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
 sizes = (quakes[:, 3] - 4.0) * 50
 paths = ax.scatter(quakes[:, 1], quakes[:, 0], s=sizes, alpha=0.5) 
 
 ax.set_title("Earthquakes in Fiji (size:magnitude)")
 ax.set_xlabel("Longitude")
 ax.set_ylabel("Latitude")
 
 # generate a legend for the scales of markers
 def scale_bar(real_scale, visual_scale):
	 ls = []
	 
	 for scale in visual_scale:
		 l = ax.scatter([], [], s=scale, edgecolors="none", facecolors="C0")
		 ls.append(l)
	
	labels = ["%.1f" % i for i in real_scale]
	leg = ax.legend(
		ls,
		labels,
		ncol=len(real_scale),
		frameon=True,
		fontsize=5, 5
		handlelength=2,
		loc=8,
		borderpad=1.8,
		handletextpad=1,
		title="Magnitude",
		scatterpoints=1,
	)
	
scale_bar(np.linspace(4.1, 7.0, 5), np.linspace(5.0, 150.0, 5))
```

In a best case we would use colour to do this, here we set it to orange at a higher magnitude and purple at a lower.

```python
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 5))

ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 1, 1)
ax.set_facecolor("black")
paths = ax.scatter(quakes[:, 1], quakes[:, 0], c=quakes[:, 2], s=20, ↪→cmap="magma")

fig.colorbar(paths)
ax.set_title("Earthquakes in Fiji (colour:depth, size:magnitude)") 
ax.set_xlabel("Longitude")
ax.set_ylabel("Latitude")
```

**Colour maps**: Colouring of markers is done via a colour map, which maps scalar values to colours

Colour maps should always be presented with a colour bar which shows the mapping of values to colours. This is an example of a guide used for an aesthetic mapping beyond the 2D coordinate system.

***See the [matplotlib docs](https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps.html) for more details***

### Unsigned Scalar

If the data to be represented is a positive scalar, use a colour map with monotonically varying brightness, meaning as value increases so does the brightness. `viridis` is good, as is magma. `These` are **perceptually** uniform.

 - **monotonic**: brightness increasing data value always leads to an increase in visual brightness
 
 - **perceptually**: uniform a constant interval increase in data value leads to a perceptually constant increase in value

#### Perceptual Linearity

**Colormaps shown in grayscale. Good scales should be monotonic (i.e. always increase/decrease in brightness)

- **BAD and NONLINEAR: the notches do not appear to be even 
- **GOOD and LINEAR: notches are even**

```python
plot_w_colorbar(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], cmap='viridis', title='Good color mapping: ↪→viridis')
```

---

```python
plot_w_colorbar(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], cmap='magma', title='Good color mapping: ↪→magma')
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.30.39.png]]

---

```python
plot_w_colorbar(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], cmap='copper', title='OK color mapping: ↪→copper')
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.31.05.png]]

---

```python
plot_w_colorbar(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], cmap='Pastel1', title='Bad color mapping: pastel')
```

This isn't nice as there's not much difference in the contrast here

## Lines

Lines are geoms that connect points together. A line should be used if it makes sense to ask what is between two data points.

### Linestyles

Line geoms can have variable thickness and variable colour

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

ax.plot(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], label='Winter', linewidth=1, color='red')
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q2[:,2], label='Spring', linewidth=2, color='black')
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q3[:,2], label='Summer', linewidth=4, color='green')
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q4[:,2], label='Autumn', linewidth=6, color='black') 

ax.set_xlabel('Date (years AD)')
ax.set_ylabel('Gas consumed (megatherms)')

ax.grid("on")
ax.legend()
ax.set_ylim(0,1500)
ax.set_title("UK Gas quarterly gas usage 1960-1986")
ax.legend()
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.37.11.png]]

---

These may also have different dash patterns to distinguish lines, without relying on colour. More than four dashes is a bad idea though.

```python
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], label='Winter', linestyle='--', linewidth=2)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q2[:,2], label='Spring', linestyle=':', linewidth=2)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q3[:,2], label='Summer', linestyle='-.', linewidth=2)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q4[:,2], label='Autumn', linestyle='-', linewidth=2)
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.38.24.png]]

### The Staircase and the bar

In some cases, it makes sense to join points with lines because they form a continuous series but we know that the value can't have changed between measurements. For example imagine a simulation for tracking winning a coin toss.

```python
np.random.seed(5)
coins = np.random.randint(0,2,(8,))
total_heads = np.cumsum(coins)
```

This makes no sense as an ordinary line graph. We can't be half way through a coin toss

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
count = np.arange(len(total_heads))+1
ax.plot(count, total_heads)
ax.set_xlabel("Trial")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of heads")
ax.set_title("Coin toss experiment")
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.40.52.png]]

In this case, a staircase (or step) plot is appropriate. This connects points with lines, but keeping the value fixed until a new data point is observed, rather than linearly interpolating in between.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.step(count, total_heads)
ax.set_xlabel("Trial")
ax.set_ylabel("Number of heads")
ax.set_title("Coin toss experiment"
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.41.36.png]]

---

If measurements of x are naturally discrete (e.g. days of week, conditions in an experiment) then a bar chart may be more suitable. 

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

ax.bar(q2[:,1]-0.25, q1[:,2],label="Winter", width=0.3)
ax.bar(q2[:,1]+0.1, q3[:,2], label="Summer", width=0.3)
ax.legend()
ax.set_xlabel("Year")
ax.set_ylabel("Gas (megatherms)")
ax.set_title("UK gas usage, 1960-1986")
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.43.00.png]]

## Transparency

Geoms can be rendered with different **transparency**, so that geoms layered behind show through. This is referred to as opacity. Transparency should be used rarely since it may make graphs hard to interpret.

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

ax.plot(q1[:,1], q1[:,2], label='Winter', color='C0', alpha=0.1)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q2[:,2], label='Spring', color='C1', alpha=0.1)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q3[:,2], label='Summer', color='C2', alpha=0.1)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], q4[:,2], label='Autumn', color='C3', alpha=0.1)
ax.plot(q1[:,1], (q1[:,2]+q2[:,2]+q3[:,2]+q4[:,2])/4, label='Mean', color='k', ↪→alpha=1.0)

ax.set_xlabel('Date (years AD)')
ax.set_ylabel('Gas consumed (megatherms)')
ax.legend()

ax.set_frame_on(False)
ax.set_ylim(0,1500)
ax.set_title("UK Gas quarterly gas usage 1960-1986")
ax.legend()
```

# Coord

So far we have assumed a simple model for coordinate systems, we have just mapped two dimensions onto a two dimensional image with some scaling, more precisely we have assumed the mapping from data to visual units is linear mapping.

In matplotlib for example, we can control the visual units of a figure using figsize when creating a figure (which, by default, are in inches).

The axes will span some portion of that figure, and these define the coord for the visualisation. The axis limit `ax.set_xlim()` and `ax.set_ylim()` commands specify the data unit range which is mapped on.

```python
# different visual units, same data units
small_square_fig = plt.figure(figsize=(2,2))
small_long_fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,2))
large_square_fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8,8))
large_long_fig = plt.figure(figsize=(2,8))

ax = small_square_fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.plot(gas[:,1], gas[:,2]) 

ax = small_long_fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.plot(gas[:,1], gas[:,2])

ax = large_square_fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.plot(gas[:,1], gas[:,2])

ax = large_long_fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.plot(gas[:,1], gas[:,2])
```

### Aspect Ratio

In some cases aspect ration will be important, by default circles will be squashed we can fix through:

```python
# this is definitely circular!
angle = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 100)
x, y = np.cos(angle), -np.sin(angle)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,3))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,3,1)
ax.plot(x,y)
ax.set_title("Incorrect (default) aspect circle")

# correct the aspect ratio to 1:1 
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,3,2) ax.plot(x,y)
ax.set_aspect(1.0) # 1.0 means height = 1 x width
ax.set_title("Correct aspect circle")

# force the aspect ratio to 2:1 
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,3,3)
ax.plot(x,y) ax.set_aspect(0.5)
ax.set_title("Forced oblate aspect circle")
```

### Log Scales

Sometimes a linear scale is not an effective way to display data. This is particularly true when datasets have very large spans of magnitude. In this case, a logarithmic coordinate system can be used.

```python
# what should we call a continent?
islands = np.loadtxt("data/islands.txt")

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(8, 4))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 1)
ax.step(np.arange(len(islands)), np.sort(islands))

ax.set_xlabel("Index")
ax.set_ylabel("Area (000's sq. miles)")
ax.set_title("Areas of major landmasses on Earth")
ax = fig.add_subplot(1, 2, 2)
ax.step(np.arange(len(islands)), np.sort(islands))
ax.set_xlabel("Index")
ax.set_ylabel("Area (000's sq. miles)")
ax.set_title("Areas of major landmasses on Earth (log y scale)") ax.set_yscale("log")
ax.grid(True, which="minor")
fig.tight_layout() # fix overlap
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.54.50.png]]

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.55.01.png]]

#### Log Log Scales

Log-log scales (log on both x and y axes) are useful when there is a (suspected) polynomial relationship between variables (e.g. y = x2 or y = x 1 3 ). The relationship will appear as a straight line on a log-log plot. It essentially prints the data on a log scale.

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 14.57.38.png]]

### Polar

Cartesian plots are the most familiar coords. But some data is naturally represented in different mappings. The most notable of these is **polar coordinates**, in which two values are mapped onto an angle θ and a radius r.

This most widely used for data that originated from an angular measurement, but it can be used any time it makes sense for one of the axes to "wrap around" smoothly. The classic example is radar data obtained from a spinning dish, giving the reflection distance at each angle of the dish rotation. Similarly, wind data from weather stations typically records the direction and speed of the strongest gusts.

```python
las_vegas = np.loadtxt("data/las_vegas_wind_2000_to_2017.csv", delimiter=',')
direction = las_vegas[:,0]
speed = las_vegas[:,1]

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12,6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,2,1)
ax.scatter(direction, speed)
ax.set_title("Cartesian plot of wind speed in Las Vegas, 2000-2017")
ax.set_xlabel("Direction (degrees)")
ax.set_ylabel("Speed (mph)")

ax = fig.add_subplot(1,2,2, projection='polar')
ax.scatter(np.radians(direction), speed, s=15)

ax.set_title("Polar plot of wind speed in Las Vegas, 2000-2017")
ax.set_xlabel("Direction (degrees)")
ax.set_ylabel("Speed (mph)")
```

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 15.00.57.png]]

***An issue comes with Negative numbers (again) The sign issue raises it head again with polar plots – there isn't a natural way to represent radii below zero on a polar plot. In general, polar plots should be reserved for mappings where the data mapping onto r is positive.***

# Facets and Layers

We have seen several examples where **multiple geoms** have been used in a single visualisation. There are two ways in which this can be rendered: * as distinct **layers** superimposed on the same set of **coords** * as distinct **facets** on separate sets of **coords** (with separate **scales** and **guides**)

## Layers

Layering is appropriate when two or more views on a dataset are closely related, and the data mapping are in the same units.

```python
wheat = np.loadtxt("data/Wheat.csv", delimiter=',')

fig = plt.figure()

ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)
ax.plot(wheat[:,1], wheat[:,2], label="Wheat price/quarter bushel")
ax.plot(wheat[:,1], wheat[:,3], label="Weekly wage")
ax.legend()

ax.set_xlabel("Year")
ax.set_ylabel("Shillings")
ax.set_title("Price of wheat and weekly wage of a skilled worker")
```

# Communicating Uncertainty

It is critical that scientific visualisations be honest; and that means representing uncertainty appropriately.

## Error Bars

![[Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 15.15.13.png]]

This is a very bad visualisation. It summarises the results using a mean, and compares them. But the data consists of a sample of measurements and the variation is important. Is OJ consistently better than VC? How much should we believe this? How certain can we be of these results?

```python
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(1,1,1)

# plot the 95% CI for these means, which is 1.96 times the standard error

def ci95(x, axis):
	return 1.96 * (np.std(x,axis=axis) / np.sqrt(len(x))) 
	

ax.bar(
	np.arange(len(interventions)),
	np.mean(vcs,axis=1)[:,1],
	color='C0',
	width=0.25,
	label="VC (95% CI)",
	yerr=ci95(vcs,axis=1)[:,1],
	capsize=4
)

ax.bar(
	np.arange(len(interventions))+0.25,
	np.mean(ojs, axis=1)[:,1],
	color='C1',
	width=0.25,
	label="OJ (95% CI)",
	yerr=ci95(ojs,axis=1)[:,1],
	capsize=4
)

ax.legend()
ax.set_ylabel("Tooth length (mm)")
ax.set_xlabel("Intervention")
ax.set_xticks([0,1,2])
ax.set_title("Mean tooth length increase under two different Vitamin C ↪→administration regimes")
ax.set_xticklabels(["0.5mg/day","1.0mg/day","2.0mg/day"])
```
