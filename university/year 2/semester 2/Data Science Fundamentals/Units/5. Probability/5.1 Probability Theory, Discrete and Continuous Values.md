# Submarine Go Boom?

During the Cold war the US lost a submarine, they needed to find it as they didn't want it to go into the hands of the commies. They had to find this item with no certainty on where it was.

Imagine dividing the possible area into grid squares then calculating the probability it's in each square.
# Definitions

- **Experiment** (or trial): an occurrence with an uncertain outcome
- **Outcome**: the result of an experiment
- **Sample space**: the set Ω of all possible outcomes for the experiment
- **Event**: subset A⊆Ω of possible outcomes with some common property
- **Frequency**: how often an outcome occurs in a sequence of experiments

**Probability**: the probability of an event is the degree of certainty than an event will occur (use P[A] to denote probability of event A) 

- `P = 0` → This event will never happen 
- `P = 1` → This event will always happen 
- `P = 0.5` → There is a 50% chance of this event happening

**Probability distribution** A mapping of outcomes to probabilities that sum to 1. This is because an outcome must happen from a trial so the sum of all possible outcomes will be 1.

**Random Variable** A variable representing an unknown value, whose probability distribution we do know. The variable is associated outcomes of a trial.
